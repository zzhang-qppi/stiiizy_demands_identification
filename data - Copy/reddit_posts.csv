0,GURL YOU GOTTA TRY PLUG PLAY SO MUCH BETTER.,2023-6
1,Just chip it off?,2023-6
2,eh i mean slightly better but not like rosin vs distillate better or anything. by me its not worth the extra per but i know Cali has them for around the same price as the Stiizy i believe so it prob is there,2023-6
3,I tried but it won’t come off smh,2023-6
4,"imo plugnplay has better distillate then stizzy yea it’s not rosin ofc, but the flavor and high is way better",2023-6
5,"This guy knows the PLUG world ain't no joke. Once you go plug, Stiiizy is scum.",2023-6
6,Your paying way too much though it’s cheaper on the website that same kit is only $25 on the website !!,2023-6
7,"Looks good dude , personally you kinda paid alot like these other ppl mentioned , but all good I guess aslong it’s real right ? Anyway next I suggest look for them in any cbd sure they should ship them I think like 20-30 bucks for the same thing pop and a battery starter pack . Or like each pop for 13 a pop if I remember correctly . I been hearing too x-blend version is pretty nice and danky haven’t tried it yet but will soon .  Compared to og pod and they og line pods do they get you high . Even if a little",2023-6
8,do u smoke thc? What’s the high like on these?,2023-6
9,no known fakes of stiiizys hemp line. everything looks good,2023-6
10,It’s legit. Gelato is my favorite so far. Got that gassy funk I love.,2023-6
11,I think thats just the battery though right? This comes with a 1g pod and battery for 50 i think is a good price,2023-6
12,Nope the battery and the pod is $25 on their site,2023-6
13,It doesnt let me buy pods on their site and im in California. It says weed vape pen and battery for 20 but in the description it says pods sold separately. Did you buy from their site?,2023-6
14,Are you on the stiizy hemp site or the normal site? They are separate.,2023-6
15,What is Stiizy Hemp? Is it like a THCA version? I don’t understand how else they could sell them online to everyone?,2023-6
16,get their new 1g disposable if it’s available around you. the 1g one is rechargeable,2023-6
17,plus its live resin not just thc distillate so hits better too (imo),2023-6
18,The disposables are all distillate.,2023-6

20,lmaooo I scanned my pods out of pure curiosity and they were coming back as invalid even though one of them had previously scanned fine and I was about to hit up the plug good thing I saw this 😂😂,2023-6
21,"https://imgur.com/a/Z87zGQD

if you bought from a licensed dispo, you have nothing to worry abt",2023-6
22,I posted a picture of me warming one up in the ac slots in the subaru sub and I got flamed. Wasn't even driving.,2023-6
23,why would you warm it up via the heater?,2023-6
24,no. the pod can go either way in the battery,2023-6
25,"This is such a genuine question. I love it. I’ll say, match the stiiizy logo to the battery you got. So you got two stiiizy logos on the same side. That’s how I do it. But yes, it is interchangeable.",2023-6
26,why is it harder to take a hit though sometimes when the pod is facing a certain direction?,2023-6
27,why is it harder to take a hit though sometimes when the pod is facing a certain direction?,2023-6
28,Cause you’re too lit and hitting that battery so much and not clearing with a cap. That left over smoke solidifies and clogs it. Just like a bong you don’t clear leaving residue.,2023-6
29,Pineapple Runtz is phenomenal,2023-6
30,"Pink Acai is always sold out when i go. It's my favorite. The pinapple runtz is okay, every time ive received a bogo they give the pinapple runtz free.",2023-6
31,How’s pink acai,2023-6
32,"Idk bruh pink acai was not it at all like idk. Shit was a big ass let down , got it from a legit dispo greenstone in Cali . Pineapple runts smacks though definitely hands down one of the new best",2023-6
33,What was wrong with Pink Acai? Smacks for me and this is my 3rd time getting it. Each time it was as good as before,2023-6
34,What’s wrong with it?,2023-6
35,lol it’s done bud. Just enjoy rest but every hit it’s gonna waste like 3 more hits worth sucked in to the sides and bottom smh. I love stiiizys but a lot of them been messing up like this. I been using plug and play and regular carts. Plug plays never do this. Watermelon z stiiizy my fav stizz though smh.But If you got it at dispo go exchange it.,2023-6
36,Never ever ever leave it anywhere in your car. Maybe if you live in like Vermont but 99 percent of the time I’ve seen friends leave their stiiizy in the car on a normal day and they come back and it’s ruined. Also never leave it in direct sunlight for long periods of time that will super heat the oil and mess up your pod real quick.,2023-6
37,"Yo I get what happened now. It happens most with the watermelon one from what I've experienced. But it can happen with any cart. Just don't leave it upside down or sideways in your pocket. Always have it upright and it won't clog or leak. Also, just know pocket heat can make it fluid and thin enough to move around in the cart.",2023-6
38,Not until you get a special edition battery.,2023-6
39,what special editions are there besides the camo and FTP?,2023-6
40,Stiiizy is trash,2023-6
41,you don’t gotta do all that even. just scratch off the CA weed logo and ur good that’s just a nic vape they don’t care abt it,2023-6
42,in your pocket,2023-6
43,fake. super outdated packaging yet claims to be made in 2022. batch id reads incorrectly and it’s missing the CA! warning on the mouthpiece of the disposable,2023-6
44,They sale this 80$ in eu,2023-6
45,How do you like it!! Is the taste good,2023-6
46,"pretty good high off it, taste is a lot like watermelon sour patch",2023-6
47,They just came out with 2 Gram pods now! Only $25,2023-6
48,No they didn’t 💀 that’s some boof shit,2023-6
49,"Nah, probably confused em w the disposables on their website, which are 2 grams and are $25",2023-6
50,Wish Stiiizy would legitimately sell in NYC already 😒,2023-6
51,Wym scan ? Don’t you gotta scratch off the things to revel the barcode then scan ? Like the pods what I’m referring too idk about the blunt packs . Honestly dude if it’s to good to be true cause it is . Nyc don’t sell legitimate stiiizy products yet . I live in nyc myself and i have a plug who gets stiiizy and plug play and others that I can be sure they legit . I had smoked cali stiiizy straight from dispensary when I go there and obviously the cali ones scans are 100% verified and these nyc ones I get from my plug aswell i buy pods off him and his pods scan legit . So then I saw some in a smoke shop not even dispensary a normal smoke shop had stiiizy got curious and bought one paid $70 and didn’t scan like it wasn’t verified I went back and got my money,2023-6
52,"you’re good, verification checks out",2023-6
53,i know but still feel like fakes can verify these days ya never know,2023-6
54,"you’re good, these just came out. that’s just a glitch in their system, one they’ve had on and off for awhile now",2023-6
55,how is the all in one? can you refill it? what do you do when you’re done with it?,2023-6
56,Flip the pod around 180,2023-6
57,"This happened to my bf last week, took it back to stizzy and the manager said to flip the pod around and it started working after that! The “CA!” Logo on the pod has to be facing the same direction the “stizzy” logo on your battery, he said!",2023-6
58,What if my pod dosnt say ca,2023-6
59,[removed],2023-6
60,"yes, it does ship to my state. lab results say there is .292 d9 and .3 is the legal limit. it’s on the hemp site, and it says thc is not detected.",2023-6
61,"I’m smoking this rn, it was the only hybrid cart in stock. Not too bad, a little too sweet.",2023-6
62,Does this happen when the pod is new?,2023-6
63,sometimes yeah,2023-6
64,"I've been having a lot of issues with Stiiizy products lately, and I even purchased from an actual Stiiizy location and same issue. Not the same problem tho.

To prevent clogging, I always slide the pod out of the battery as I finish each hit, to ""clear"" it. I learned this when I put the rubber cap on top and saw a little puff come out the side vent, and it's helped tremendously.

But the last 8 pods I've gotten aren't clogged or leaking...just not hitting right. Straight burning the coil. Wicks aren't drawing the distillate up.",2023-6
65,"the thing is, i do the exact same ""clearing"" method. i've just gotten more discouraged to use it considering that it feels like nothing i do, no matter how many precautions i take, i still have trouble with the hardware. maybe it's still me doing something wrong but im doubting that more as time goes by & i use my stiiizy(s) more",2023-6
66,I've switched to PNP over the last month and it's been alright but I miss how my Stiiizy CDT was last year and before. Not a big fan of most carts either. Before this massive drop in quality I really considered them the most reliable/consistent experience.,2023-6
67,Passed on this flavor for the Apple Fritter CDT probably gonna have to try this one,2023-6
68,I have an unopened one I’m waiting to try. Finishing off a Strawberry Shortcake CDT first. I enjoy that one quiet a bit.,2023-6
69,"i also love apple fritter … i  this case i actually prefer the premium apple fritter sometimes cuz i like the apple terp flavor that they add. But the fritter  cdt is nice too. Def recommend this one. It’s like a nice regular weed flavor, doesn’t taste fake at all. really nice and mellow.. great for before bed!",2023-6
70,that sounds lovely… i don’t think I’ve had the pleasure of trying that one. It’s kinda hard in my state cuz legalization just started so there’s not many flavors available yet. Basically i feel like I’m constantly flavor hunting stiiizy live resin and cdt. I love when I’m in Cali cuz it’s so easy to get whatever flavor i want especially with delivery and Weedmaps. Cheers m8!,2023-6
71,Live resin is good but to me it all taste like weed lol . but idk if u like the regular distillate pods but try to get orange sunset it’s really good .,2023-6
72,Just picked up to try also; blue dream is a nice energetic body boost. I’d imagine your watermelon z has more peaceful effects,2023-6
73,"Lmk how it is . I’m kinda iffy on trying them out . I never had d8 , HHC or x-blend so idk how they taste or if they’ll get me high",2023-6
74,"Just tried and it's pretty good, 4 hits get a nice high and it tastes like watermelon sour patch",2023-6
75,Oh nice at least you for high from it . How are the hits are they rough ? Also what is even a x-blend mean. And where could I purchase some of these pods . Like in ny city,2023-6
76,legit. verification checks out,2023-6
77,looks good to me,2023-6
78,Orange Sunset,2023-6
79,orange sunset is sativa  but we all known sativa/indica isn’t really a true thing i guess u can say . but anyways i love orange sunset that’s my favorite one it taste good and gets you like a high-uplifted feel but also couch locked IMO .,2023-6
80,will it make me giggly?,2023-6
81,i’ve gotten three hits out of it i think it’s just clogged with oil,2023-6
82,"I’d say the $60 is worth it. I pay $45 for a full gram pod here in a illegal state (GA) and paid $35 for a battery. I recommend getting the big stiiizy battery since it’s double the voltage of a regular stiiizy battery. The big battery helps out a lot with clogging and getting the oil heated up enough. A full gram pod usually lasts me 1-2 weeks give or take. That’s with using it multiple times a day, everyday. Plus my tolerance is very very high.",2023-6
83,all completely relatively ur tolly and hm u smoke. Big battery is good idea like above suggested. Personally I get the gram pods for less than that or about that price so i DONT think the small half g ones are worth that price. plus the half g ones usually come with a battery right? unless im confusing them with another. they released a few types of pods now. u can get the battery via their site. You can also easily price check local dispo’s to compare the pods price as area matters,2023-6
84,"half g pods don’t usually come with a battery, you are confusing them w the LiL stiiizys which are the disposable half gram pods w battery attached.",2023-6
85,yes 8ths go as low as 15$ for the stiiizy around my area . 20-30$ for 7 grams .,2023-6
86,"Impossible to tell via picture. Everything can be faked from the barcode to the valid scan. 

You can also get bad synthetic weed. It's not exclusive or carts. 

Also, watch out for pesticides, mold, crushed glass ( makes of look frosty. ) and perfumes to enhance smell.

Other than checking with stiiizy or calling the dispensary and asking them to see a coa, there is virtually no way to tell if yours or anyone eles product is legit.",2023-6
87,Cali?,2023-6
88,Which do you prefer ?,2023-6
89,look up a growing weed video on youtube lol or a grow house tour. color differs the higher you go up the plant depending on strain and pheno.,2023-5
90,Bro it’s a plant. Not all of them are going to look the same.,2023-5
91,"bro you’re buying fake stiiizy products you clearly don’t know ish 😭 and to falcon, i literally worked with someone from their dtla production side and they said they label the same bags different strains.",2023-5
92,"you just smoke carts, and live in georgia i actually don’t care about anything you have to say cuz you really just showed you know nothing about bud",2023-5
93,what’s that other pod?,2023-5
94,It’s the delta 8 one ?,2023-5
95,"The other 2g dispo is ""Blinkers"" which is a sister black market company of Littos. Regardless tho Blinkers is bm so id be careful. Ive heard mixed things bout them.",2023-5
96,"Compared to stiiizy, how do u like it?",2023-6
97,"Blue burst is sooo gross but all the others are super fire, especially ice cream cake. A really nice regular bud tasting pod.",2023-5
98,What dispo?,2023-6
99,there is no fake ones. they made stiiizy hemp 40 pre rolls you’re good,2023-5
100,I’m pretty sure there is no way my broke ass plug can afford boxes of them,2023-6
101,answered your own question in the description,2023-5
102,Cheersington,2023-5
103,Guh.  I remember taking a 100mg edible and going to Six Flags.  A big mistake!,2023-5
104,do they allow stiizys to be brought in,2023-5
105,Yeah but I suggest you put it in like a backpack  I haven’t done it with it just in my pocket,2023-5
106,bet thank you,2023-5
107,How much are they usually,2023-6
108,Tbh it looks real to me. Stiiizy has been having problems with their verification for a while now. Happens to alot of other ppl,2023-5
109,They dont make la kush cake could be a Fake what was the url for the site on the code when u scan if,2023-5
110,[deleted],2023-5
111,cuz if it is the solventless line it would explain why it tastes burnt … u can only puff on it for like under 5 seconds and wait like ten min btw hits,2023-5
112,are the solventless ones the CDT line?,2023-6
113,"If it's white, that means it's fully charged. Leaving it plugged in for hours may have damaged the battery. What does it do when you hit it? It should be white.",2023-5
114,"thank you for responding i'm desperate for help loll

when i hit it i don't taste anything at all except maybe a slight burnt taste, but i don't feel any burning in my throat like I normally would. there's a little smoke that comes out of the pod right afterwards, too, but i'm not sure if that means anything. I thought it was supposed to blink when it was fully charged; does it normally go back to red every time you charge it?",2023-5
115,"If it's not fully charged, then it will be red when you plug it in and solid white when fully charged.

Are you sure it's not plugged up? If it is plugged, hit it real light, just enough to make it turn on the light. If you don't get one faint popping sound after about 4 seconds, blow through it and repeat as necessary.",2023-5
116,"yes, i'm not sure if i was clear before, but when it's charging it'll be solid white for a long time. but if i unplug it *just a moment later* and plug it back in, it'll be red again for at least 30 minutes.   
i've disconnected the pod and made sure i can feel airflow from the bottom and side before using, and I still feel and taste nothing",2023-5
117,[deleted],2023-5
118,i used the contact us page today because any address i entered would result in an invalid address message. Did you send them a message under customer support or general inquiry? i messaged them this morning and they still haven’t got back,2023-5
119,How does the pink aci taste like wasnt really a fan of the Apple fritter,2023-5
120,i s2g the all in one is not a full gram,2023-5
121,So what is it a disposable or sum like the all in one that is?,2023-5
122,Is it worth the purchase?,2023-5
123,"what’s better for me to get ? all in one, small or big battery? i’m just tryna get zooted before i sleep. also what pod is the best for indica?",2023-5
124,Yeah upon opening I instantly noticed comparing to their regular pods.,2023-5
125,"Yes, essentially. Oil seems more potent, and they are more $$",2023-5
126,"Well if you don't care for money I'd get the all in one. Definitely seems more potent and Biscotti will do you right haha. The pods, though I'd go for one of indicas on the cdt line. I love their CDT pods. There's literally over 30 different indicas",2023-5
127,I noticed when it ran out in 5 days 😭,2023-5
128,are u talking about the live resin pods? bc they have the most amount of options i can see,2023-5
129,Try watermelon z or gdp both have good taste and not bad potency,2023-5
130,Thanks for the recommendations. By any chance are these a head or body high? My tolerance is low and I’m not looking for a head high feeling.,2023-5
131,Live Resin or Soulventless are the way to go more of a overall high rather than the OG pods (distillate) is more of a head high,2023-5
132,I see. Yea I’m not looking for a head high feeling I had a bad experience. I Just something mellow after days work to unwind before I sleep. What would recommend I start out with? Do stiiizy carry soulventless pods?,2023-5
133,Get their distillate if u just want to go to sleep as their solventless is their highest potency product and thts cap that their distillate is all a head high lol,2023-5
134,I see. Damn guess there’s no way around that head high. I do some more research if anything I’ll head to stiiizy shop see what the budtenders say. Appreciate the info,2023-5
135,Tbr the guy above has to b capping as i barely ever get a head high from their distillate pods unless its a sativa or sativa dominant hybrid,2023-5
136,Oh ok. I’m new to the stiiizy wave so I’m just trying to get as much info as I can.,2023-5
137,Ofc ofc hopefully my replies helped a bit and if u need anymore explanation on anything stiiizy feel free to dm me,2023-5
138,I do have a couple more questions. 1st what’s good base to start off with if I’m going with indica distillate flavor wise. Knowing I have a bit of a low tolerance. Something to ease my way into.,2023-5
139,if you are looking for a good taste for a indica try purple punch,2023-5
140,Have you tried watermelon z?,2023-5
141,"How many posts are we going to get like this, no hate but bro you could’ve just searched “clogged” on here and gotten an answer quicker than posting. Every single one of my pods do this and all it takes is inhaling on it off the battery used until it unclogs",2023-5
142,"First, try to blow through it. If that doesn't work, hit it real light, just enough to make the light come on. A hard hit will give you a drop of near burning hot wax in your mouth when it does clear. If it doesn't clear in 4 seconds, blow through it while it's still hot to clear the clog.",2023-5
143,Take it off the battery and pull until you hear the *POP* and you start hearing the airflow a lot better,2023-5
144,man you have no idea what you’re talking about. don’t listen to this guy. if it’s clogged just dry hit your pod (pulling/inhaling from it while it’s not on your battery) will unclog it. sometimes you have to suck hard and for longer than you’d think. don’t fucking blow in it what kind of advice is that. i feel like most of the people who say stiiizy isn’t good are just not the brightest in the head,2023-5
145,"No bud, it's you that has no idea what you are talking about. With 4 big and 4 small batteries, over the last 2 years, I've dealt with every problem there is.

If you stop and think about it. Hitting lightly to activate the heater will melt the clog and help clear it. ""Dry hitting"" it without the battery just means you have to hit it that much harder to clear it. You heat it up and blow through it because hitting it sucks wax into places it doesn't belong and THAT'S how it gets clogged. Blowing through it pushes that wax back where it came from. It will also prevent you from getting a blob of hot wax in your mouth when the clog clears when hitting it in the battery. But you aren't smart enough to figure these things out. 

You are right though. Anyone that says STIIIZY isn't good, like you about clogs, just isn't the brightest in the head.

Oh, and when you graduate form 2nd grade, you might actually learn what capital letters are for. You missed a period too. Looks likes you haven't even learned how to use spell check. lol",2023-5
146,"my stiiizy is not spewing wax out the top, maybe try to actually take care of it and not let it overheat etc. my clogging just refers to airflow being blocked. there’s no wax needing to be pushed out of the way or anything for me so you needa chill😭everyone has different experiences with things",2023-5
147,"In my experience, blowing back after getting some from the top will make it shoot out the sides on the mouthpiece, I’ve never made a issue about it with my local dispensary, but one time I purchased they said if I have issues with clogging or having it spit out a ton I could go back swap for new, they are so cool :)",2023-5
148,Enough,2023-5
149,Every 3 days is very standard tbr i have to charge mine every half a day since ill romp tf out my pods,2023-5

Yes, I've had both black market and regulated.

Gross.",2023-5
160,for reals?,2023-5
161,I know it’s real. But are they major the boxes smaller now or just angle ?,2023-5
162,"I’ve opened up a few stiiizy pods now and I’m pretty sure you’ll be more than fine. 

I believe that’s just one of the coils (there’s two on each side) that connects to the two little magnetic dots on the bottom. I don’t believe anything bad is gonna happen at all. If anything, I don’t believe that the pod will even work since it’s no longer touching those pins it looks like. But if it does…make sure it doesn’t taste burnt or anything 🤣

Bad batch nothing more imo. Stick with 510 threads 👍",2023-5
163,what the heck 😂 i would take it back if u can to refund,2023-5
164,I just got a replacement pod today (got to keep this one) still works but doesnt hit that great lol,2023-5

190,What makes you say that,2023-5
191,i have gotten fake ones too from “plugs” years ago before i was 18 and they always had the weed logo in that exact spot. real stiiizy batteries have never had that Ca logo there or any kind of cannabis warning on them because there isn’t an thc in the battery just pods. also the magnet is much stronger than normal stiiizy and the bottom part at the charging port comes off easily. might use your pods faster but can’t do much harm.,2023-5
192,Appreciate that bro went out an got new big battery had an old one but don’t have the box so don’t know if that was legit but I got a new big one an it didn’t have the CA on it,2023-5

194,"What has worked for me is taking very small hits at first. Like barely getting any vapor hits. Once you build up a tolerance increase the size of the hits. Ride the high and tell yourself it’s only temporary and will wear off in a couple of hours if you get anxious. I’ve slowly built up to taking bigger hits and not getting panicky if I get too high. Only get high in comfortable settings either by yourself or with someone you really trust until you know you can handle it.

I ordered a bottle of the Stiizy X blend gummies, delta 8 gummies, and the delta 9/CBD gummies. I have only tried the x blend so far which is basically a mix of delta 8 & 9 and took slightly less than my usual amount with various other brands and got better effects. 

I haven't tried the pods yet but have heard those are really fire even for people who don't love HHC. I feel like overall all Stiizy products are great in my experience, hemp line or normal legal line. Plus I only paid $59 for 3,000 mg of gummies shipped. I ordered them on Wednesday and got them by Saturday.",2023-5

I wrote down yesterday how I felt:

I began to notice that I was finding myself disassociating and generally exhibiting some behavior that I don't think I'd have while sober. My motor skills are also slightly off and I've had an inability to focus as well as I used to. Time perception also feels strange, it doesn't feel like a whole day has just passed. I'm able to remember things, but it just feels strange. Not sure if brain fog is the right word to describe it but it feels like I'm slightly intellectually impaired. I'm genuinely unsure whether this is placebo and I'm just hyper aware of everything or if there's actual brain damage. I've yet to go to the gym and exercise since I've read that can just get you higher; I'll do that today.

since writing this, I went to the gym last night and felt much better; it seemed like the effects were gone and that I was functioning normally. It's Saturday morning now and I feel like the effects are coming back a little bit. It's really difficult to tell how much of this is placebo.",2023-5
253,"The serial number will not work for stiiizy verification, that’s only for use with their vapes. 

It is also normal for you to feel differently when taking edibles than you do when sober, you may just not be a sativa person (I’m not either)",2023-5
254,I’ve gotten this before with edibles in general like a weed hangover feeling that lasts a few days. I will say it’s been more noticeable to me on delta 8 gummies versus normal delta 9 gummies but they should in edible form process directly into the same thing so could just be me.,2023-5
255,"are these edibles delta 8?

it's been slightly over a week since I took the edible. At this point I'm back to normal, but every now and then something kicks in ever so slightly. Tends to happen when I'm in an unfamiliar place or situation.

Instead of learning search functions on Twitter n all, I learned the platforms I was stuck to (snap for chatting and Facebook for family).

I was just hoping for a bigger connection than “yep! That’s us!” when asked, still just seems up in the air (which is valid with alt noids being kinda up in the air, 2023 farm bill fuckery).

I agree. There’s some behind the scenes posts hinting that it’s HHC-P > HHC-O, which raises questions about these altnoids’ synthesis / whether it’s an organic product vs what’s effectively modern spice. I think only time will tell to see whether this product line gets more promo or dies out with federal legalisation, and they still haven’t responded to me re that. At the same time, a major brand entering the Farm Bill legal space puts more pressure to federally legalise. 

Fingers crossed … I’m hoping for the best.",2023-5
287,"Been keepin an eye on them too, the tech behind it with portable accounts n all that seems like a good future for social media compared to every other “revolutionary idea”. Not sure how you feel about the r/altcannabinoids space but H4CBD has been helping me a bit, slightly psychoactive cbd. Fair warning it’s thick for vapes though.

I see a space for it, but I also see the malice behind hiding how it’s made and all. Basically none of it besides trace amounts are directly derived from hemp, most are converted somehow from another precursor. So while each one genuinely may offer benefits to some users over THC, the reactants, catalysts, and literally anything else used may contaminate the product unless properly tested. Additionally some of the more knowledgeable users in the alt noids subreddit have pointed out differences between K2/spice and these noids, something about those synthetics being less similar to the natural compounds, with thc-jd being the only culprit out there in the wild.

I’m hoping that no matter what, the industry’s little detour into alt noids wasn’t for nothing yk? Each noid and every variation of that noid is entirely unique, almost akin to strains.

301,"So the only thing I can tell you is that when packing your stuff so not attempt to hide it have it on your personal or carry on if. 

If TSA or Customs sees it and decided to confiscate it that will most likely be the end of it because they know it's for personal use. It's when you have it in a checked bag that the bag gets flagged and you get pulled to the side and you have to answer questions in my personal experience. 

what I usually do is bring disposable pens they don't get a second look because they look like the nicotine disposal pens that everybody has these days. Stiiizys are a tough one because they are in a separate battery and a big cart of disty. Where I'm at Stiiizys are costly and I have the Biiig battery so I don't like risking confiscation so I'll buy the disposables from my local shop.

 All and all this is still against the law depending on local laws where you're traveling too.

338,that's wild omg... i'm relatively close to their HQ/main labs which is mostly why i'm confused but at this point i'll shell out $80 (although that's ridiculous imo lol),2023-4
339,that shit is so fake ☠️☠️☠️☠️,2023-5
340,"Nevada is one state that sells their original line of products, it’s not fake bc it doesn’t resemble what you have. Just a different product. 

The PACKSPOD might be boof tho. Can’t find it on their local Weedmaps or Leafly.",2023-5
341,I found it on 1 dispensary in vegas can't be fake lol 😆,2023-5
342,"The WCG pods don’t come with verification bc they were such limited supply. One way you could verify is if the coupon code inside works on the STIIIZY website. Otherwise, return it for a pod with verification QR if you’re that high anxiety. Have you never used **this** delivery before?",2023-4
343,"I just wished to make sure no verification QR code was normal for the 420 pod since on other ones it would be a red flag. I personally never used the specific service before, but it has multiple reviews on Weedmaps.",2023-4
344,"Just to be safe, I’d check their licence info against the state register. As long as the address is identical, you’re Gucci.",2023-4

354,Yes taste amazing I actually did not expect it to I thought it was gonna be more on the flower side than taste but it’s on point 🫡,2023-4

361,Smart using the bottom rubber as a cover for the top noted🤔💯,2023-4
362,"Stiiizy has great quality product, but their hardware is so Shitty for the pods. I can’t stand them because of that. But their flower is on point😂👍",2023-4
363,i thought that’s wat we all used it for ?🤔,2023-4
364,That’s true but if you keep it standing up it should be okay . I haven’t had any that leaked out but I have had a lot that tend to clog up from being left on the side,2023-4
365,Stiiizy just dropped in chicago. This a new tip for me and i appreciated it so i commented.,2023-4
366,I regret not getting more 😭😭 how much where they at your dispo ?,2023-4
367,"I regret not buying more either! Especially since I've had friends buy them too, I only ended up with 2 lol. I'm a medical patient so I get them for 34 a cart!",2023-4
368,I was getting em for 25$ here in Michigan recreational 🤯🤯 but yes I only got 2 as well I feel as I should’ve gotten 10 just of these !! 😭😭 there so good ! They need to put this one is shelves it’s like watermelon z witha punch of purple punch and gelato ot something !!,2023-4
369,"Damn 25 is good as hell. I live in cali so it's always expensive but for 34, it's not bad for me at all. :) they are so super delicious and it hits smooth and hard. :) I definitely agree that they need to put this flavor o  the shelves cause I though Pink Açai was good but damn that was better!",2023-4
370,I live in Chicago a .5 is 40$ plus 35% tax like 60$ a .5 lol I drive out to Michigan 2 hrs . Definitely worth it . Drove out just for this cart and many more 😭😭 . I always get like 10-15 stiiizys when I make the drive . Do they ever have deals in cali . They usually have 5/105$ in Michigan !,2023-4

377,Dang I didn’t know they had these,2023-4
378,i was having extreme pain (still am) and the thc/cdt ones help me so much. also my tolerance is insane and i only need 2 or 3 to really feel it that says something,2023-4
379,First 3 days I took 2 gummies each day. Felt nice and sedated. On day 4 the 4 remainders I have didn't have any affect on me. I see OP took the whole box. At 30 dollars a box it doesn't seem like a cost effective way to get high,2023-4
380,"aye nice man, def will be worth the weight 👍👍",2023-4
381,"my tolerance is really low so i decided to go for the whole pack which is 100mg, shit hit me very hard lol and was high for id say 3ish hours or so",2023-4
382,wait,2023-4
383,bro wtf 😭 i genuinely greened out off 40 and was high for 10 hours,2023-4

385,[deleted],2023-4
386,Did you verify it yourself the first time?,2023-4
387,Yea I have,2023-4
388,Then why are verifying it 4 more times?,2023-4
389,"I think you’re good bro, I mean a huge red flag is if it’s been checked before and if you’re the first idk how much more legit you want 😆 i can’t think of any other way to prove it’s real other than the fact it had been unscanned before opening and the oil and cart look right..",2023-4

392,Nice deal . How you got that deal ? From what I know the stiiizy dispo was give 20% off they stiizy items,2023-4
393,"Damn that’s sucks !! Maybe try to keep them upright as much as possible, I’ve never had this problem personally",2023-4
394,how does that pod hit ?,2023-4
395,SoCal deals 🙏,2023-4
396,"I had that battery. It eventually stopped working. And like everyone else said, it's the pod. I'm finally realizing that its time to try different brands.",2023-4
397,"Ok so they changed something with their manufacturing in january. Hoping they fix it…here’s what works. 

- Keep the pods upright ALWAYS.

- If it’s cold, warm it up before you hit it- I stick mine in my pocket or waistband, you can also use a hairdryer. Must make the wax flow easier, I don’t know. 

- don’t hit blinkers. I fucking love blinkers. Don’t do it, these shitty new pods can’t handle it.

- biiig batteries tend to hit hotter than  the normal ones. Just fyi. 

-that pod is fubar. You could drain it and dab it, that’s what I’m gonna do with my 4 pods that have clogged. Annoying but I can’t waste that much. Hope stiiizy fixes it but the biggest thing for me was not hitting blinkers. If you take big hits your battery is probably fine and it’s just the pods.",2023-4
398,[removed],2023-4
399,had to switch to plug n play was having the same problems,2023-4
400,"It heats up really quickly but it comes out from the mouth piece and it’s so annoying, I’ve cleaned it several times and everytime I try to take a hit it’s either air or the wax. Should I just get a new battery? It’s really such a shame if that’s the case cause I liked this one. :/",2023-4
401,Legit,2023-4
402,"Stiiizy changes their hardware all the time, also I get pods from a dispensary near me, and sometimes they scan invalid, this is a rapid problem stiiizy has been having for the past year, I’m leaning towards real on this pod, looks exactly like my LA dispensary pod , the hardware looks good too, the magnets have been looking like that on my recent pods",2023-4

408,Ngl id be snacking on a bag of these if they werent edibles,2023-5
409,Is the high to much ? I haven’t smoked in a few months and my tolerance isn’t as it was like before when I would smoke daily so I’m sure I’ll get high pretty quick . I just don’t wanna get to high I get paranoid . How long do the effects last ? I don’t do edibles to much either . The pods I smoked a lot befor,2023-4

442,"omgg i’ve been craving this flavor forever, would u say it’s worth it?",2023-4
443,I been hearing the pod taste like the pink starburst. I do enjoy the strawanna pod,2023-4
444,How's the flavor??,2023-4
445,Is pink açaí good ?🥹,2023-4
446,Yea yea nice pod. But damn those pants are fire sheesh.,2023-4

453,Does it smell like dank?,2023-4
454,Did you have to sign for the package?,2023-5
455,Anyone have any idea how to get these in Cali? Their website won't ship here :/,2023-6
456,I love the potency.. a few 4/5 secs hits vs 3/4 blinks to get same effect.. and these last longer (high wise) lit for hrs,2023-4
457,It's smells and taste of Herb 🌿 no cap. the regular HHC was more flavor.,2023-4
458,"I’m hitting the THCO Biscotti, and I’m completely in couch mode. I know I should get up but can’t. I’m shocked at how hard these bad boys hit.",2023-4
459,They have THCO?? I saw they had some pics up but didn't know if they pulled them off .since the whole THCO was banned 🚫 stuff,2023-4
460,"They’re only sending them out to certain shops. Basically its one of those things where if they can keep their mouth shut, they’ll send them, but its on the Low Low since Stiiizy is just now announcing themselves to the hemp world. 
Its important for companies to keep a low profile, especially when dealing with hemp derived weed, bc there are so many grey areas w/ the law… which is why I’m hella careful which company I buy from. Stiiizy’s reputation precedes it so I immediately decided to try these.
THCO is derived from Delta 8, but if you know what you’re doing, you can go to the moon faster than if you vaped actual THC. If you see the X-Blend Ingredients, you see there is not THC-O. THCO is not for your average consumer. 
Since THCO high’s are close to the real THC, not the Delta hemp… There is more grey area so most companies stay away from THCO but the reality is that its legal as long as they keep it under law guidelines. I’m so lucky my shop has them all. Gelato is beautiful too, but I mentioned Biscotti bc one of its Parents is Gelato. Both these strains are some of my favorites.
I should mention that I’m toasted as hell off a couple hits lmao.",2023-4
461,"Go to strains are biscotti as well as gelato,  i love the  terps and the over all effect they have always smacked for me .. anything go to would you classic blue dream",2023-4
462,Why does it look All scratch and what’s that white shit on the mouth peice ?,2023-4
463,It’s scratched that’s an indication that it’s been coming in and out of pockets. It looks reused. So I wouldn’t if I were you.,2023-4

465,"If you mean the QR code, I did that, I used the verification website",2023-4
466,"Yea lmao it was the Carmex I put on 😂, the hit kinda irritated my throat so I made the post, I was just thinking it’s the distillate because I’m used to hash rosin and live resin",2023-4
467,"If it came back legit 
I’m confused on why ask? Lol",2023-4
468,"I got it from a shop not a licensed dispo, and the distillate irritates my throat at times, was just asking the subreddit to be safe.",2023-4

472,You should also try the kush mintz 👌,2023-4
473,I had the wrtmln live resin full gram pod and half way through it tasted so burnt,2023-4
474,i’ve been getting that a lot lately with regular pods (like purple punch) to the point it burns the shit out of my throat,2023-4
475,Where'd you but them? I'm looking for somewhere that the Stiiizy hemp pods are in stock but I'm not having too much luck.,2023-4
476,Ya'll know these are over the .3% legal limit for total THC right?,2023-5
477,One of my friends in the vape industry got samples from vegas at a trade show when stiiizy first launched the new line. Hoping to see them in my local shops soon,2023-4
478,Just checked the lab results on their website. Why spread false information? lol,2023-5
479,"Do you know anything about nycglass718, element vape, or myvaporstore? Those are the only websites that have the pods in stock but I don't know if they're scams or legit.",2023-4

490,"if u have a tolerance id say cdt is the move but the average user can still get great highs from bdt, definitely not as good tho. bdt is great just bc cdt exists doesn’t mean bdt is automatically “ass”",2023-4
491,Lol y’all must be new to black market weed market. Thailand has legal bud but there black market is crazy.  Y’all gonna have heart attacks when you find out Cali packs are taking over Thailand if you think this is crazy. YouTube got some wild videos on it check em out. They are there Courtney even better. Every Cali brand is out there.,2023-4
492,uhhh show?,2023-4
493,No like fake tasting. Doesn’t taste like gas yo,2023-4
494,"Right? Every other cart tastes like it’s original terps, the original stiiizy pods taste a lil artificial, I got a purple punch pod the other day and it tastes like they added a botanical berry terp just rlly sweet and unrealistic not gas",2023-4
495,it says “green apple flavor” on the package so u know if it’s gonna be a weed/herb/gas tasting one or not. if you want stiiizy pods that that aren’t sweet & fruity then don’t get the ones that are flavored. stiiizy has 4 different lines of pods so i’m sure you can find what you’re looking for. cdt is much better than the bdt (og) ones imo but i like the sweet flavors.,2023-4
496,there’s 4 lines of stiiizy pods and the kind you are talking about has sweet ones and gas/herbal tasting ones. i think you would like cdt tho,2023-4
497,"Yeah I didn’t really know the difference between the cdt and original since there’s nothing on the original box that says anything about terpenes it just says the strain name , I haven’t had the cdt ones but I think I’d like it cause I enjoy natural cannabis derived terps it’s just better than botanical added ones and gives a better overall high imo",2023-4
498,"fake, mail it to me and I’ll properly dispose of it, all jokes aside, you can’t tell from the pen alone, you need the box and qr code, if u scan it and it’s the first time it’s ever been scanned it’s legit",2023-4
499,"In the least incriminating way possible, do you have this much stock for personal use or do you sell?

514,I want to try these so bad 😭😭,2023-4
515,Wtf??? Real stiiizy makes HHC pods???,2023-4
516,I literally called Stiiizy dispensaries to confirm. It’s SO new it’s basically unknown. They just launched the website and such,2023-4

519,Im about to delete this app. This shit is so fake,2023-4
520,how did you find these? is the website back in stock?,2023-4
521,Comparing it to a regular stiiizy the rod in the middle looks thicker and the Stiiizy font seems more bold on the HHC pod. I didn’t see these in the products on the website any links?,2023-4

They're cheap as hell for a reason",2023-4
524,Speed to market!!!!! Let's go!!!! I can confirm it's fire can't wait to try the x Blend pod,2023-4

529,My brother got these and I hit it they taste close as shit to the regular ones but they still seem sus to me,2023-4
530,I would rather smoke a stiiizy with real thc lmao,2023-4

It can be quick delivery (within the hours) or scheduled (few hours to days ahead) but the quickest delivery limits what you can buy, based on the dispos options. After you get set up and order, there is an option between standard delivery, discreet delivery, and curbside delivery. There’s also a special instructions area n shit.

With that, I think the best way in your situation would to jus select curbside, n then put a spot on campus where to meet up in the special instruction prompt, then do the process as normal when they come thru.",2023-3
626,"YO FUCK THESE NEW PODS. They changed some thing with their manufacturing in the last few months since January and these fuckers don’t work. They keep getting clogged and mine have all that wax down in the bottom like yours. Four out of the six pods I have bought have been bad. And I buy them directly from a Stiiizy dispo. So fucking annoying!! 

I ended up opening up a faulty one the other day, I used pliers to pull the plastic piece off the bottom, and then to pull out the silicone seal, and I let the wax drain out into a small empty wax container for dabs. I put the pod in my car to heat it up using the greenhouse effect so the wax would drain out, if it wasn’t warm enough to that I’d try my toaster oven on a super low setting. 

So getting the wax out…At least I’m not throwing money away since I can use it with my dab rig but  I hate using the torch 🙄 if they don’t  get their shit together and have better pods by the time I’m out of everything I have now, I’m switching to a different pen!! So mad because I’ve been stiiizy gang from the start and it’s honestly disrespectful af to us, their customers, to be putting out such low quality pods. 

Ok. End rant. Sorry🤣",2023-3

630,i bought 2 and within days they both ended up like that^^ it’s annoying. i found that if you put your finger over the holes on the bottom and blow into the mouth until it pops. some wax will come out of the side but it works after,2023-3

It seems to make a bigger difference than ever if you keep your pods upright at all times, and let them warm up in your waistband or pocket, upright obviously, before hitting them. Especially for big hits like blinkers.

If they don’t get it together by the time I’m out of all the pods and wax I have, I’m gonna switch to a different type of pen. Hope I don’t have to!",2023-3
728,It's shit and their stores have started making excuses for not exchanging the broken ones. Switched to plug n play and have enjoyed it about the same or slightly more. Definitely lasts longer without the QC issues,2023-3

823,pods/carts don’t go bad. idk who told you that they only last 10 months but that’s not true. thc just degrades into cbn (sleepy cannabinoid) over time so the pod will hit more like a heavy indica,2023-3
824,"Stiiizy store sells old ones like that all of the time.

It still has drugs in it you will still get high. 

Stiiizys get clogged ALOT. There will be times where you  hit it but you actually don't get any product. 

Make sure it isn't clogged. Make sure you hear the coil cracking (vaporizing the oil, sounds like bacon cooking) 

There's nothing wrong with an old pod",2023-3
825,"No one told me that, I just noticed that the older they get the less potent they are. With the old ones I had I didn’t get high no matter how many times I hit it.

826,Copy that! Thank u,2023-3
827,If you're not getting high no matter how many times you hit it then there's something wrong. Either your tolerance is thru the roof which happens when you vape concentrates a lot. Or maybe you're not hitting it right 🤷‍♂️,2023-3

Stiiizy hasn't stooped to their levels but I felt I just wasn't getting my money's worth from their pods anymore.

I've tried everything, I'm taking these 3 back next time I go and gonna switch to something else until they get their quality control in check or whatever the issue is. (I know what I'm switching to I just don't want this to come off as negging Stiiizy to promote another brand).

Or the pod gets clogged completely. I’ve mainly used the smaller battery but also have the big battery, and there doesn’t seem to be a difference in whether it clogs/leaks or not. I’ve read that you’re not supposed to leave the pod in while the battery is charging, or really leave it in the battery at all when not in use. I’ve also made sure to keep the batteries as fully charged as I can, made sure the connection between pod and battery are good and clean, and kept the pods upright. This has been an issue with every pod I’ve ordered for probably the last 6 months or so. I’ll attach some photos. Is this just a common issue? Let me know if there’s any other ways to prevent this from happening. I’ve had to toss pods that aren’t even empty.",2023-2
907,"Your getting it too hot

Leaking pods/carts are 98% caused by user error. 

Passing around a group of people. Chain vaping, etc. any pod or cart should have a 30 second break (at least) between hits. 

Can I get a bunch of down votes now please 🙏",2023-2
908,This happened to me too a lot recently. I don’t have a solution but I did switch to different carts besides stiiizys and I’ve been problem free since.,2023-2
909,"Here is what I do, but I cannot say that it is a permanent fix. Toothpicks, alcohol. Dip the toothpick in the alcohol and stick it in the mouthpiece part right in the center. Push it down and spin it. Keep doing this with a clean, alcohol-soaked toothpick until the point does not stick in there anymore. BLOW through the mouthpiece until it lets you do so freely. It took a while for some of them. Before putting it back in the battery, make sure you can suck and blow air through the mouthpiece. To help keep it from getting clogged again, but this is not an exact science, blow through the mouthpiece from time to time. Every time I smoke, I blow through the mouthpiece before I set it down. I have yet to throw a pod out. But I have been very frustrated through this. I learned the blowing part from a YouTube video. The alcohol and toothpick were my last resort. But I have done it more than once to at least one of the pods I have. Virtually all of mine are 1 g.",2023-2
910,Idk i disagree that pods haven’t always been kinda shitty. I used to use my stiiizy a lot more about 4 years back as well and my pods would ALWAYS get clogged (half full or even full) although it seemed to be more of a problem with the half gram pods. At the time I was making okay $ and didn’t care so I’d toss them lol,2023-2
911,doesn't matter if your ripping a stiiizy my friend,2023-2
912,Yeah I’ve heard a lot of people say to switch to Plug&play.,2023-2
913,Are you taking repetitive blinkers or hitting it back to back? Saw some people mention that it can lead to clogs. Was having a similar issue recently and noticed the clogs were less frequent when I didn't put it in my pocket right away and didn't take back to back hits.,2023-2
914,"Keep upright, don’t overheat, patience, and don’t suck it like a thick milkshake… it should be just fine if you follow these simple things. 

In 10 years of using carts and pods, I have had maybe under 10 ever have a problem and I think that’s stretching it. 

These are just my experience and opinion of course.
mine did this too but i also would take a lot of consecutive hits. i try to keep it away from heat so away from the heaters in my car. also try to keep it standing up! this also helps",2023-2
915,Idk. I have legit had mine for about 4 years now lol. And it still works. Beautifully every time.,2023-2

922,real. I just checked the verification and it’s good,2023-2

926,I get mine from a plug and theyre all legit. I think you should be fine especially if scanning the box checks out,2023-2

964,"Take it a step further get cured resin or live resin, some affordable choices; coldfire (catalyst dispensaries, 45$ Sundays they 15% off) alien labs 22-32$ for cured or live resin Same goes for connected California but out of my range I’ve seen these more expensive for some reason, but then there’s also plug plays which hit bit more than stizzys, there’s raw garden live resin+ cdt, then buddies cdt, live resin diamonds, or distillate all the above range from $22-38 + depending if there’s deals, crescos usually cheap live resin def worth a shot
(just recommendations)",2023-2
965,Yea I fw live resin a lot but I get it delivered from stizzy cus where I live there no dispensaries out here so most of the time I spend alot just on a few pods,2023-2

970,Honestly same kinda wack,2023-2
971,Whats wrong with solventless? Im only on the normal pods so idk what the differences are,2023-2
972,"Nah you’re trippin, CDT and live resin are ⛽️",2023-2
973,U can only smoke the pod for 3 seconds or it will burn and the entire pod will taste burnt. Then u have to wait ten minutes before taking another. Stiiizy recommends only using on the small battery . All this info comes on a lil piece of paper in the solventless pack. They aren’t worth it imo,2023-2
974,i haven’t tried the CDT have to do that any strain suggestion? live resin i’m still ehh about maybe i gotta try them again,2023-2

981,Damn. Ive seen em for 80. Talk about a pricey pod for less thc. What are even the benefits then that make em more expensive,2023-2
982,It’s live rosin which is usually amazing. But stiiizy batteries don’t have a temp control and live rosin is supposed to be smoked at a low temperature so these just kinda fall short smh,2023-2

I stopped buying stiiizy maybe 2 or 3 months ago because i kept getting defective carts too. Try out plug n play, honestly they almost hit too hard.

Ive really been liking abx carts. Absolute xtracts. Theyre really good. And they have another sub brand called loud + clear. Ive been buying those carts and they been getting me fucked up.",2023-2

I just hate that I can’t keep a Stiiizy in my pocket and hit it naturally. If these pods suck try the solvent less pods they didn’t clog on me but not as potent.,2023-1
1091,do You take a lot of blinkers,2023-1
1092,"It’s 10000% related to heat exposure. 

I posted about this and maybe 10+ people all agreed  in the stiiizy Reddit here that theirs was also leaking out the top due to the higher temps in our homes cars offices jobs etc etc. like I was sitting in my car freezing blasting 99* degree hot air in my face to warm me up while I’m taking blinkers (that means long hits to the OP) in the heat of my car was instantly the cause of the oil coming up the mouthpiece. 

I also use to keep a separate stiiizy in my room but under the heater vent and after I run the heater all day then go to smoke and my pen was sitting under the heat exhaust outlet so it also then caused it to come up the mouthpiece.

Once I recognized his I stopped the heat and kept it away from the stiiizy completely and haven’t had oil come out the mouthpiece ever since I became more self aware of where I put my shit, like these motherfuckers are very sensitive to heat unfortunately. So do ur best to keep it upright still always but in a cold dark place when not hitting it. (And never in ur pocket all day that’s not good)",2023-1
1093,?,2023-1
1094,I don’t know if it’s heat causing it unless only the newer pods are vulnerable. I had no issues keeping mine in a 100+ degree car last summer yet most pods I’ve gotten since late Nov have had issues.,2023-1
1095,A blinker is when you inhale on your vape to the point that the led ( whether its the illuminated button or power demonstration light ) flashes to show the battery has been exhausted for that puff. Typically a 7-11 second inhale on common vapes.,2023-1

1259,"there are fakes that are 1:1 with this packaging and pod. if the scratch off verification took you to verify.stiiizy and not verify-stiiizy and you were the first to verify, you’re good",2023-1
1260,Fr scary how good these fakes have become.,2023-1
1261,Not with a stiiizy pod it’ll already get clogged before you take it out the box,2023-1
1262,"Weed is carcinogenic, not dangerous enough to worry about. Definitely a lot safer than nicotine",2023-1

Smoke or whatever tf is in vape cloud almost certainly is.

1264,"Jesus, where are you located? 120 for 2 is a ripoff. I like these, but can see why a lot of others don’t like them. Also, I only ever pick these up if there’s a sale going on, I would not pay 60 for one. 

They do tend to burn if you’re taking blinkers or long hits, but overall I like the flavors. I do agree that the high with these is significantly less than with the regular distillate pods though.",2023-1
1265,"I got a solventless cart once (Stiiizy Rozay) and was not a fan at all. I found the flavor really unpleasant... hard to describe, but it tasted like I would imagine a decomposing forest floor would taste. Hints of literal grass taste with notes of mushroom? Like I said, hard to describe but in no way would I associate the taste with cannabis. I couldn't finish the cart and threw it away. Maybe I got a bad batch but it was funky. Also I didn't really get a buzz",2023-1
1266,Yo where you getting solventless pods in nyc lmk please,2023-1
1267,NYC but the prices here match that in Arizona … my girl picked me up the cdt line carts out there i think  they were like 45$ per half g,2023-1
1268,"This “flavor  profile” that u are describing is pretty accurate on all their solventless flavors imo. I’m actively trying to not burn this pod, which isn’t easy cuz i like to take full puffs (not necessarily a blinker but a nice full cloud)… it’s alright but still not worth what i paid. Imo the live resin is their best pod line!",2023-1
1269,"I got my local spot in Astoria to pick them up, still in stock was there today. But 60 for a half g, was pumped for rosin bc it’s like impossible to find here. I’d say it’s not worth it tbh",2023-2

1276,The white guava cdt tastes like steamed peas. Cannot stress enough to avoid it lmao,2023-3
1277,"I love them! Jealousy is def my favorite so far but i haven’t opened the lemon cherry yet. The ice cream cake was half smoked, like there was half the amount of oil in the pod which sucked !!!",2022-12
1278,"yo honestly thanks because i was thinking about copping different fruit ones. Have you had their papaya, idk if it’s cdt but i want to try it.",2023-3
1279,I haven't had the papaya but I've had the lemon cherry and a few others which were all good the white guava was just something else hahah,2023-3

And people who drink whiskey. People who drink beer wants to just drink to get fucked up. Where people who drink whiskey are the ones who like to chill and relax and know what they're drinking. I didn't say anything how strong or weak the strain is.",2022-12
1288,i stopped buying their brand after dealing with a series of defective pods and batteries. one pod somehow bricked several of my batteries as well.,2022-12
1289,Tbh I’ve been switching over to Plug Plays which imo hit harder then Stiiizy but I really like how discreet the BIIIG Stiiizy is when out in public,2022-12

1292,any better pod system recommendations👀,2022-12
1293,This keeps happening to me and it's also spitting hot oil onto my mouth when I try to take a hit. I have been baby-ing these last two ones I bought and they're all doing the same thing. It gets worse when they're almost out. I hate it and think I'm going to find a different brand.,2023-1

1302,"THIS!!!! it’s been almost a year since i quit stiiizy but i worked there for over a year at multiple locations and everything you said happened at my stores too. it’s genuinely the worst dispensary chain to work for. on top of the constant surveillance by management, micromanaging, excessive changing of SOP, and general inconsistencies by MGMT, you don’t even receive any of the same perks budtenders at other dispensaries do. all you receive in the quarterly “goody bags” are expired product and shit no one wants, while other budtenders get goody bags biweekly with FRESH product that is actually safe to consume. these other budtenders also get opportunities to do budtender training in order to receive free product from popular brands, or opportunities to attend huge cannabis networking events like hall of flowers and emerald cup, but stiiizy doesn’t want their budtenders to have those experiences like other dispos do. also the fact that they stay open 365 days a year and don’t even alter their hours on major holidays on top of this THC % inflation lawsuit just screams capitalistic greed. the fact that they fired budtenders that walked out of a 100F degree store bc they’re too lazy to call someone to replace the A/Cs is proof enough they have zero integrity for their product, employees, and customers. they don’t even know how to take care of their inventory. my store had a broken concentrates fridge for MONTHS before upper mgmt decided it was time to fix it. that means people were buying deteriorated solventless products, like expensive top shelf shit that’s $80-$90+ per gram. they would keep so many eighths of flower in the LED cases and then would try to make us sell bleached ass flower that no one wants 😭 literally zero integrity. it’s FUCK STIIIZY forever. the dispensaries’ upper management is ran by former high school teachers, it’s why working for them makes you feel like you’re back in the 5th grade again. even being in elementary school i had more liberation than working for STIIIZY. i don’t understand how they think they can have successful stores when literally 95% of their staff leaves every 6 months",2022-12
1303,What is a good alternative to stiiizy?,2022-12
1304,"YES YES AND YES. they will fire you within your first three months so that you don't secure a union position. you're not union until that probationary period ends. i literally watch as they mislead customers every day and i can't do anything to help. btw, if you return something they've made an ""exception"" for - you get banned from the store for violating return policy. even when it's their fault. Ive seen my store manager ban a customer for returning a 7g bag that weighed in at 5g since that technically violated the policy. Foul asf. The fact their turnover rate is roughly 73% should tell you enough.",2022-12
1305,"Left coast have pods that (kind of) fit the battery (sometimes it’s a loose fit and you have to hold the pod in place). They sell their own batteries too. 

But with the stiiizy class action about the potency % not being anywhere close to what’s advertised, I’m really reconsidering pods all together. Convenient but a lot of uncertainty",2022-12

1312,"I’ve been using stiiizy for a few years now (100-150 pods)  and I’ve gone through the whole lines of Live Resin, Cannabis Derived Terps and the cold press they released. Can I ask what battery are you using and how often are you blinking ? The live resin is thicker than Distillate so it takes longer to heat up but a slow 7 sec inhale is the max you should be using it and then let the pod cool off for a minute then repeat process. If you excessively heat the pod then the pod starts to leak and it’s gross. If you try this method out let me know if it works. Have a happy holidays man",2022-12
1313,Plug and play 🔥🔥🔥,2022-12
1314,The oil is miscolored like it’s burnt. We’re you hitting blinker after blinker? 🧐,2022-12

1327,I’ve been smokin stizzys for years and very rarely does the oil get in my mouth. How hard are you hitting that shit bro,2022-12
1328,I’m sorry I don’t think I understand you’re question but to the best of my understanding this is what you asked. “How come stiiizy live resin pods taste like just bud compared to the stiiizy flavored distillate pods” it’s simply just terps when it comes down to it. One has added terps for strain specific flavors when the other has the taste of weed through the whole process. I hope this is able to help you,2023-1
1329,"I mean, I like stiiizy pods WAAAY better then those fucking c-cell disposable tanks. Those batteries are garbage. I personally have never had a problem with stiiizy pods leaking. Like they have 100% success rate for me. This blows my mind you got four in a row. Makes me wonder if your storing them somewhere weird or just coincidence",2022-12
1330,"I mean, for now it’s just a claim. But the lawsuit involves another 3rd party testing proving stiiizys laboratory results were faked.

1334,"Look anywhere on this reddit, probably over 100 posts about pods leaking",2022-12
1335,Bro don’t you think if the third party did the lab test and found the inflated thc percentage then logic dictates they would’ve found the pesticides in that same lab test? All you are doing is speculating rn the lawsuit involves only pre rolled joints and only because of inflated thc percentage was found that’s all it doesn’t involve any other of their products and certainly doesn’t involve lying about pesticides,2022-12

When I’ve spent over $20,000 with stiiizy, all for personal consumption, I know what I’m getting every time and how to go about using it. Never have I had a faulty product from them, is it impossible, no we’re human but on the other hand I also have never seen someone so butthurt about $60. When others genuinely try to help you, be polite you bum ass nigga.",2022-12
1338,Bro i’m not a fucking weed fanatic i don’t give a fuck if it’s my “ favorite brand” it gets me high and i’ve never had any issues with it nor has any of the other dozens of people I know who smoke it either. Maybe accept it’s a you problem weirdo,2022-12
1339,Just like I said “what over products” meant to say other obv but it’s still 100% fair to say that if they faked potency lab tests on any product that all of their lab tests should be disregarded.,2022-12
1340,Bay Area,2022-12
1341,It’s almost as if you just saw the headline of the law suit and didn’t read into it at all what you are doing is speculating not based of any evidence just speculation you asked if they are unsafe due to this lawsuit the answer is no this lawsuit only involves their thc pre rolls and doesn’t have anything to do with pesticides and safety,2022-12
1342,Just because the law suit is about pre rolls doesn’t mean that they couldn’t have tampered with past or current lab tests for other products. Potency and pesticides are tested by the same laboratory and on the same report.,2022-12
1343,bruh again I ask you how come this third party lab test of the pre roll found nothing wrong with the pesticides? smh you asked if it’s a safety issue the answer is no you are just looking for reasons to distrust stiiizy and that’s fine but stick with a legitimate reason all what you are doing is speculation only the pre rolls were found to be at fault and only the thc percentage not pesticides,2022-12

I attempted to exchange the defected one and my dispo awesomely exchanged without taking the original cart I attempted to hit so I wound up with 3 carts for the price of 1. The way we made the defected carts work was making sure both magnets on the bottom were in all the way and then we hit the pen while simultaneously holding a finger over one or both side holes in the cart which activated the hit for whatever reason, upon seeing the pen light up release the finger from the hole and continue hitting",2022-12

1374,"and it was only for their pre rolls, no mention of their actual flower, wax, or pods.",2022-12
1375,^ exactly what this guy said everything from them is legit and perfect as always but I honestly don’t know who the fuck buys there prerolls... I just smoke the CDT carts they’re the best they make. And there live resin edibles are fuckin slappers too. But yea the news about them was only because they added 10~15% thc to whatever the prerolls had.. so the label that would say “92% thc” would mean it was really just 80% instead.. but again who the fuck buys prerolls lmfaoo.

1557,"Um, yeah, no.

What is really a marketing scheme is when a producer \*cough cough STIIIZY cough cough\* is willing to OVER DILLUTE their concentrates with an abundance of Botanical Terps, for the sake of 'flavor' or informing their consumers that this product will hit anywhere CLOSE to flower or a higher quality concentrate extract like Cold Water Hash/Rosin. THAT is a scheme. Falsely delivering quality and using your company's popularity to misinform.

Also, to say that Terpenes don't contribute to the Entourage Effect, is ignorant and completely negates all the years of therapeutic/medicinal healing they have provided.

The entourage effect is a bunch of moving parts. not every role is as important as another, but together is WHY it's called The Entourage Effect. 

\*\*To the OG Poster, stop smoking Stiiizys. srsly. idk what their pod department is on, but its just not consistent and sustainable for a person. the amount of terps shoved into those pods messes up the actual chemistry of the high. I mean think about it, if you have a strain, it has a specific Terp Profile they breed for in order to get those same effects. Do you really think you are going tog et the same if you add a shit ton of Limonene? 

Try an actual Rosin Pen, idk where you are at but maybe look for some solid Rosin too.

Just sayin. I'm a Budtender from CA and I have seen some shit in the industry 0.0",2022-11

1560,That makes sense. I've tried only one other rosin cart and yea nowhere near the taste or smoke as dabbing some nice live rosin so I can see what you mean by rosin pods being a scam.

When out and about, I keep them with me in the regular battery, because it's more discreet and will last until I get back home.

Like you could even hear it spit back, what sucks is that like I said the worker tested it too and told me it leaked.

1592,Damn that’s weird then I never have got a box without the factory normal plastic seal so I don’t know.. But I would ask for a exchange for sure since it wasn’t sealed and if it’s a licensed dispo they will be happy to remedy the situation,2022-11

That sticker on bottom has never been on a stiiizy box that’s real, nor does the flavor go there, and the hardware inside the cart itself shows it’s an obvious fake. 

Sorry bro those usually still get u kinda high but NOTHING compared to what a real stiiizy would do as u said urself u noticed this shit didn’t feel like a stiiizy. I bet when u scan the QR code it will say 45,000 other people have scanned it before u. That’s usually what they say every single time",2022-11

Also if u wanna post the box to prove it that would be nice and actually I would believe u if u did that..  also its “ineffective” were ur words bro lol which only make me believe it was more a fake, literally nothing matches at all haha.

1645,These things got an expiration date or somthin?,2022-11

If not then don’t say the shit checks out. Cause I can read fake batch numbers that don’t correspond to anything all day it doesn’t make anything legit. The fact u got fake stiizys and haven’t learned to switch yet is beyond me. There haven’t been a stiiizy box like this made for over 2+ years now. I know because I’ve been smoking stiiizy carts legit for that long from real dispos 2/3 carts a week... that’s more stiiizys then u have smoked in ur life. Also I just looked and I still have old stiiizy boxes laying around from 5/21 and THEY WERENT THESE BOXES 🤣. Anyways it’s all good I don’t care that much I have insomnia was tired but couldn’t sleep that’s the only reason I cared to type up that otherwise I care less that ur wrong.

Anyways take care ✌🏽 one love",2022-11
1650,Nothing it’s all good bro nevermind. I just saw ur post try it out and if u can hit it and it works and u can feel it then keep it and smoke it bro. If u can take back to back to back rips and u feel nothing then maybe toss it.,2022-11

1653,Bro it hits after a good 3 or 4 rips,2022-11
1654,I mean it’s up to u bro the oil whether it is legit or not is still very old but if u can get any feeling from the cart at all I would say it’s still worth it homie but if ur hitting it back to back and no effects.. then I would say toss it at that point but only if it’s like that.,2022-11

In the picture is a typical regulated ecig battery, (I think a eleaf pico or something) that allows me to control the hits via wattage or voltage as well displays you the coils resistance off the head of a typical cartridge well my adapter is just a housing holding a 510 connector male (salvaged from one of those shitty ego battery chargers that thread into the battery) wired into two respective pogo pins at the distance to mate up up the stiiizy connecter and two little 4mm magnets to retain the stiiizy cart and hold it secure to the pogo pins. my adapter only achieves adapting stiiizys proprietary connector (of the carts) to any regular 'ole ecig battery you can find just about anywhere for well cheaper than a stiiizy battery.   


Obviously there are many issues with a system like this since you would be able to apply vastly higher voltages than the stiiizy carts coil was intended for as well as lower voltages but make no mistake all the real magic for temp control of your hit is just a smarter battery than the one stiiizy sells.",2022-12

last time i left the country was to go to mexico for a wedding. i got two carts in, and two of my brothers got 2-3 carts in each. I just put the battery under the seat and the carts in my sock.  Car was searched, we weren’t but never found anything. 

Europe seems to have stricter laws, and with cannabis being legalized in the states they’re probably gonna be more on your ass.

I asked my brother for some advice and he said your best bet is to just look confident, they’ll ask for your passport ID etc and how much money you’re carrying since if it’s more than 10 grand you have to declare. 

If you don’t give them a reason to search you once you land, they won’t search you. just act like a normal tourist fam, if they find it just tell them that it’s a vape. make sure you choose the strains that don’t leak

I wish your friend the best of luck mate, and hope that they get blazed on their trip :)",2022-10

1771,The only thing the battery does is sends power to the heating element in the pod to turn the wax into vapor. I would bet that something inside the pod was damaged. Find a friend or maybe somebody at the dispo with a battery that you can try your pod in. I like to have a spare battery in case I forget to charge it or to test for problems like this.,2022-10
1772,"Personally if you're used to buying rosin already then just stick with what you got. But if you're new to rosin or only smoke stiiizy and wanna try it's a great starter to get the experience. The flavor is much better than a regular stiiizy pod. But it is easy to ""burn the pod"" or just make it taste bad. 
In comparison to other rosins it's not the greatest but I wouldn't say bad. There are just way better tasting and way terpier solventless extracts on the market",2022-10

Maybe you’re projecting 🙃",2022-10
1812,"Sure, it was good live resin (lemon creme for the sativa. Papaya indica) but it’s never the strain that gives me anxiety, it’s my inability to moderate that inevitably leads to me to the same exact situation, without fail: 

**overserving** myself, which leads to severe discomfort, which leads to self loathing, which leads to no good. 

I don’t respect myself when I’m high, but I like being high. If endorphs weren’t involved, the call would be an easy one- on paper, the call remains an easy one. 

In application…not so much. The fast onset and lasting debilitating effects of live resin (even shit distillate, tbh) are hard to argue with when one wants to “relax”",2022-10
1813,"i understand, happens to me as well. i just let the panic and anxiety in, just for a moment. take in the discomfort, then preoccupy myself with something productive or entertaining.",2022-10
1814,"Oh yeah, I always work through it. But my inner monologue went something like

 “bro do you even enjoy this? Are you proud of yourself? This happens once a day, is it worth the trade off? If you get rid of this, you won’t have to feel this way ever again.” 

Every time I convince myself that I can moderate my intake, the same thing happens: 

First week I’m fairly responsible, only get high twice (sativa early evening, indica late night) a day. 

Then as the days pass, more of my day is spent being high, until I hit the point where I get high immediately after my post-workout-lunch. And then I don’t do **anything** for the rest of the day except what I absolutely **must.** 

Kills my drive/ambition/self-esteem. But fuck does it feel good. I love being sprawled out on my bed playing video games, jaw finally unclenched, brain dumping endorphins, massaging my muscles with its beautiful feel good chemicals. 

ADHD, man. That instant gratification. I might buy some bud today, tbh, who knows. But if I do, I know I’m just prolonging the inevitable.",2022-10
1815,"Damn dude, I can relate hard to this. I also have ADHD symptoms and have an unhealthy relation with cannabis when I have it in abundance. A psychiatrist I consulted with to get my CBD prescription told me that what he considers to be the most serious side effect of weed is something called marijuana amotivational syndrome, which is basically what you described. Getting high early in the day and then not doing anything else, then feeling like shit for not being productive, leading to low self-esteem which is compensated by getting high again.    
It's really easy for people with ADHD to latch onto habits and substances which provide quick dopamine release. You have to re-educate your brain to get that dopamine from healthier activities, things that stimulate you while also making you feel like you're progressing towards something, either a personal goal or a passion you have. I'm guessing you're a creative person, I recommend channeling your energy into some type of art or craft (music, writing, woodwork, gardening, etc.). It's helped me a lot.    
I hope you can create a healthier relationship with weed. You don't necessarily have to quit it forever, just treat it like a reward after a day of hard work or a treat for special occasions, instead of a crutch like you said.",2022-10
1816,"Yeah I’m a professional trombone player. Man I remember in college all I did was chain smoke backwoods blunts in my apartment, practice bone and sell weed. 

Didn’t go to any non-music classes. Dropped out of college to go on my first tour :,)

Doesn’t help that the San Fernando valley has the tastiest fucking OG in the world. 

I ended up buying flower yesterday, and got high. Much better high than the live resin. Doesn’t completely fuck my brain for the day (plus I waited until late to do it). Love my vaporizer (super silver surfer)

If they’re like $50 a g they’re definitely fake unless your plug has a state license and personal rep at stiiizy.

1875,Yeah it’s an old starter kit I think cause it didn’t have any brand relevant stickers on it other than the seal I also checked the inside the pod is too smooth like it does not make you cough at all and I can’t really tel if it has an affect,2022-10

Just so you know, I’ve had a stiiizy rep before through a friend. He spent $10k per month with invoices and shit. I rode along with him to the DTLA location and parked on the vendor side with him. Stiiizy wholesales their pods at around $32. Most plugs can’t get wholesale (you need a state license) so you’re looking at $38-50/g retail. 

Now your plug (lets say he’s in Houston, like me) has to have a connect buy your plug pods, and pay his connect, and pay shipping + postal insurance and pray the package isn’t seized. 

Now that he’s risked thousands of dollars on product being shipped and paid his connect profit, your plug needs to turn around and make profit for his work as well. Now he’s charging $20-40 profit on top of each pod because these fuckers were hard to get. 

$40 retail (per pod)

$1 shipping (per pod) 

$10 profit to the connect (per pod) 

$30 profit for your plug. 

You’re looking at $80-90/g for stiiizys in another state. If your plug is offering $30,40,50,60 a g… they’re fake. The profit margins just aren’t there.",2022-10

You have no idea what pods go for on the bm or backdoor. Just look at my posts. I only get legit product but I never ever I have paid even close to 32 a gram pod. You would cry to know what pods go for. Stop making fake scenarios. If a pack gets seized. You just proof it happened and they send another. All your bs facts. You would cry and delete this post if you knew what plugs really charge. Picking up 1 stiiizy pod is how I can see you paying so much. If a plug even told me 20 I’d laugh.

1971,Do more,2022-10
1972,Nice chains,2022-10
1973,sounds like a way to start an addiction bru 💀,2022-10
1974,"I’ve snorted meth once (age 16) and smoked heroin once (age 17) and can confirm weed is the 3rd most addictive drug I’ve personally tried next to cigarettes and alcohol. (Social acceptance and ease of access is what makes them so deadly) heroin and meth are less addicting than weed because weed has no negative side effects while meth makes you feel shitty for longer than you felt good. (12 hour high that you can’t function on, 24-48 hour comedown… compared to a 4 hour high that I took my drivers test on, followed by a 2 hour nap and snack break lol) 

When I first started smoking weed it was once a month in highschool. Then it became once a week. Then once a day at night. Then the high at night didn’t last long enough so I’d smoke every afternoon and night. Then I couldn’t wait to smoke til after school so I smoked morning, afternoon, and night. This process continued until I was spending $1k a month smoking a gram of distillate per day. 

I still struggle limiting my sessions but I’ve gotten it down to 2-3 per day… it’s been daily usage for the past 5 years. First time smoking I was 14. I’m 21 now. I don’t regret my use because I actually receive a ton of medical benefits from cannabis but I will admit I am extremely addicted I can’t eat or sleep without it. I have taken tolerance breaks before. My longest break was 9 months from age 15-16. The entire time I was just wishing I could go back to smoking again. This is a part of my life and a part of me and that won’t really ever change and I’ve embraced that.",2022-10
1975,So you’re telling me not to take her advice right? 💀also i hope you ended up staying away from the other hardcore drugs wish u well,2022-10
1976,its nothing,2022-10
1977,Until it tastes like burnt cotton (which we allll know that taste) you are good to rip,2022-10
1978,pretty sure stiiizy uses ceramics too so idk if there would b cotton in there,2022-10
1979,Get a biiig battery if that one’s not producing enough vapor. The smalls don’t create enough imo. Happy day to u tho.  What flavor? Have u tried the live or cdt pods yet? Good chance You won’t go back to the distillate pods I know I haven’t.,2022-10
1980,They have no difference in power just battery capacity,2022-10
1981,I would avoid the big batteries for micro metals.,2022-10
1982,big pulls harder lol,2022-10
1983,Lmk if they get you high and then I’ll let you know. How many mgs?,2022-10
1984,"I've been trying to figure out if those are real too. I tried the triangles and the ones in a jar, but the QR codes don't work for their verify site and putting the serial numbers in just spins and won't show a result",2023-3
1985,"I’ve been having the same problem, I recently got the Fruit punch splash, but it wouldn’t even get out of the spins on their website. Unfortunately the edibles have not done anything for me /: I ate all of them and felt absolutely nothing, and that’s wild considering i don’t go near edibles (this is my second attempt with them) 😭",2023-3
1986,"Are the pieces rectangles with the word ""STIIIZY"" pressed into them?

The ones I have will get me high, I just hope I'm high on THC and not heroin or fentanyl",2023-3

1988,"yeah tbh i started smoking off a normal cart , so if ur looking something to ease in i think that will work",2022-10
1989,Thank you I’ll pick one up,2022-10
1990,I love the Stiiiz in nyc. So convenient!,2022-10

1992,"White raspberry is absolute fire, mind asking where you got it?",2022-10
1993,"Fuck the mets, always a disappointment",2022-10
1994,It's amazing they are so abundant in NYC. Only thing I find is the pods aren't super secure to the device like traditional screw in carts. Which makes me nervous in out of my pockets etc.,2022-10
1995,"I had that once, I didn't enjoy the taste.",2022-10
1996,They overcharging here in NY I bought a cart out of desperation in midtown and paid $70..but in all honesty I’ve never had a pod come out of my stiiizy the magnets are pretty good 👍🏽,2022-10
1997,"Tbh I like this taste a lot better then OG Kush or King Louis..but I have to stick to the regular ones cause that’s all we can get out here in NY, I miss the CDT pods in Cali 🥲",2022-10
1998,I'm paying $70 in lower Manhattan. It's still better then .5 gram carts from jersey dispensary's for $60.,2022-10
1999,My favorite is blue burst to be honest. The white raspberry tasted to citrus flavor for me.,2022-10
2000,I found a place in Jersey City that was charging 60 for stiiizy pods but I never be out there,2022-10
2001,Where at though?👀,2022-10
2002,What’s the name of that big stiiizy box,2022-10
2003,"I'll always keep both because I love the selection that Stiiizy has. They sell a lot of strains that usually aren't available in cart form at my dispensary. I would definitely invest in a good cart battery though since the cheap ones tend to break at some point, and/or suck at heating the oil properly",2022-10
2004,Does stiiizy make better indica or sativa?,2022-10
2005,I prefer indica so I haven't really tried that many of their sativas. I do like their Strawberry Cough though,2022-10
2006,"Do you know why most people have a preference for Indica? Personally, I feel sativa makes me feel lazy and not creative like people say sativa does.",2022-10
2007,"Indicas help with my anxiety and insomnia. Sativas make me a little too talkative haha, or even paranoid sometimes. It also depends on the strain though",2022-10
2008,How does one know what a good indica strain is? There's so many names!,2022-10
2009,"I use leafly and weedmaps to get info about strains, plus recommendations from my dispensary. Other than that just trial and error! What kind of strain are you looking for?",2022-10
2010,"your tolerance maybe be a little too high, try taking a t break or slowly cutting down. for example, instead of hitting it all day fry hitting it every other few hours, then go down to only at night when ur abt to go to bed",2022-10
2011,But I only smoke at night that’s the thing,2022-10
2012,"then i’m afraid that if you didn’t buy it from a dispo, you got boof",2022-10
2013,Shii hop not 😪,2022-10

2015,It’s cool Yk but it’s js that dispo prices are hella expensive,2022-10

2018,"""ages 4 and up"" i like it XD def gonna get some candy at the gas station and use ur hack thanks bro",2022-10
2019,Forgot to mention it keeps your pods upright,2022-10
2020,Ik it's a dumb question but are you supposed to keep your pods up?,2022-10
2021,You are! Otherwise the oil can leak out or settle in a way that ruins the pod before it’s run out,2022-10
2022,Their js aren’t bad but the blue dream one is terrible,2022-10
2023,That’s my favorite vape for anxiety and sleep. You won’t be disappointed… ENJOY!,2022-10

2030,Last 2 I bought leaked no more Stizzy anything,2022-9
2031,Bro you should know stiiizy is trash af expect their pods,2022-9

2035,For 25$ lol expect it be trash u get what u pay for,2022-9
2036,Been buying stiiizy diamonds for months now. They have 4gs for 100 on fridays so I’ve been on that deal and I’ve been really happy. I smoke outta my carta and rig and the flavors have been awesome. I buy my stuff directly from a stiiizy shop so maybe yours was messed with? Or possibly fake because I know the stiiizy pod scam was super common. Truthfully have no complaints over the diamonds so it might be the puffco. My friend has one and has been complaining about it a lot recently.,2022-10
2037,Bro you obviously didn’t read it all LOL but thanks anyways 😂,2022-9
2038,Thanks I totally agree now officially 😂. But I’d pick plug n play any day …just more shops carry stiiizy. But I was just thrown off by it because I never had an issue with them really… i prefer WCC but I wanted to switch it up last night because I was being lazy going off delivery 😂… but was hella curious if anyone did it in the puffco too cause that was yikkkkeeesss 😂,2022-9
2039,why do you say that?,2022-10
2040,"Low key 1000+ ppl on Reddit would agree with me saying Stiiizys CDT pods (AKA The Silver Line) is a million times better then their BDT line, and their LR line, because stiiizys battery’s can’t go low enough in volts for LR. and the SVL is 90 a Gram VS. 52 a Gram for the harder hitting, BETTER tasting CDTs.",2022-9
2041,I’ve budtended for 7yrs in LA you know damn well I only buy the real stuff. 😊 but still stiiizyy isn’t MY go to & never will be…but if I have to grab it I definitely will and smoke it on glass.. Sorry I ain’t no die hard stiiizyy Fan Lol definitely not something I go out looking for and I’d I go to the stiiizy store I’m lookin at other shit lmao if you know they don’t only sell stiiizyy…. So much better stuff out there. And my puffco was brand new at that time fyi. So it wasn’t the coil or anything 👍🏻,2022-10
2042,I didn’t once I seen stiiizy I was like this goof ball ⚽️ 😵‍💫😂,2022-9
2043,"Stick to the pods but DEFINITELY NOT THE LR pods. The SVL is great if u wanna pay 45$ a half g..... 

OR go with the BEST of all the Stiiizy pods which is their CDT line which fucking smacks harder then any other ones and tastes fuxking literally amazing from the CDTs directly related to the strain u wanna smoke. 

Trust me. Stiiizy OG here wouldn’t steer u wrong.",2022-9
2044,thoughts on plug and play and maybe if it’s a better alternative than stiiizy? only concern is the pods are 40 and my stiz ones are only 34,2022-10
2045,Sounds like you just have a strong opinion on stiiizy and that's alright. I don't necessarily love or hate them but I've found they have the best bang for your buck compared to what's offered in other dispensaries. I can't find quality diamonds like stiiizy for the same price but that's just the diamonds.,2022-10
2046,What because I never tried stiiizy in a puffco and I did once you call me a goofball 😂😂who the fuck uses that word a 10th grader 💀💀💀💀,2022-9
2047,CDT smacks iykyk 😮‍💨,2022-9
2048,Personally .To me I think so. I’m a huge fan of Taste and high. But I’ve had them all…. Even the Silver line of stiiizyy is OK too… but wasn’t anything special to me…they both are definitely more $$$ and they both don’t come in half grams. 🤷🏻‍♀️ stiiizyyy is bang for your buck & have more carriers. Just my opinion,2022-10
2049,Yea I’ve just tried it all and I’m just a picky about my medicine what can I say …. & I know what I personally like! (Nowadays) . But if you haven’t - Try west coast cure diamonds they are priced good and sold at stiiizzzyyy. !,2022-10

2114,Lots of legal shops sell fulls for 20-25$.  I refill my Stiiiz pods with distiallate from carts.  They are are just as  potent and have similar or better taste too.,2022-9
2115,I buy other brands as Stiiizys have the same taste across most of their pods. But they are about 13$ wholesale.,2022-9

2125,Nice! although if it's just for home i can just stand my pods upright. Now if u make that thing small and portable....,2022-9
2126,"If there’s enough in them you can heat the oil until it’s a runny consistency (run a lighter quickly across the pod, don’t melt the plastic). At that point I put mine upside down over a plate/cup/silicone wax container and let them drip out. 

The more oil you have = better chance of having it all travel together

Edit- A hair dryer should work too",2022-9
2127,how do u open them ?,2023-4
2128,Get two pliers. Then grip the cart by the clear end with one plier and another for the black mouthpiece. Grip the clear end as tightly as you can and start to bend the black mouth piece off. It won't budge right away so you will be going at it for a few minuets before it pulls off.,2023-4

2134,After eating the pod did your cat eat a crap ton of nachos and some ice cream?,2022-9
2135,Your cat is getting high hate to break it to you. He's either found out how to make it leak or take tiny hits some how. But he knows it makes him feel different. That's why he's singled out your pods.,2022-9

2144,Dropped in the ocean and dove down 20ft lol,2022-9
2145,What?  The battery is dead,2022-9
2146,Watching a video on A juul doing it now it’s probably the same,2022-9
2147,Fs lmk if it doesn’t work or you need help I’ve done it before the only bad thing about it is that you burn a lot of oil and get fat ass rips from 1-2 seconds if you do more you can burn yo oil,2022-9
2148,Lol when I used to do it I would blow through my carts fast but would get rips bigger than what a battery was capable of,2022-9
2149,"I mean you already smoked it😭 if you want some sauce here you go 
Take a pod smoke it like half it call the dispensary tell them you got a pod and it’s leaking wax when you hit it n burns your mouth with hot wax. They gonna switch it out ( had a delivery once where I got to keep the pod so I pretty much got a free pod",2022-9
2150,"Cdt kicks live resins ass. The difference is the extraction method used. Cdt contains more terpenes because they extract them first and add them back in because you inevitably lose some terps in the extraction method for live resin I think. 

Terpenes are made up of carbon links and there are multiple sizes from monoterpenes to bigger terpenes with more carbon. The issue is that likes dissolve likes, Cannabinoids, mono terpenes and your solvent are non polar but the bigger terpenes are actually polar so you have to change your extraction conditions to get those terps.",2022-9

2152,"My back problem is that my prescription meds destroyed the soft tissues in my spine. I could feel each bone sitting on the next. OG Kush in a STIIIZY vape pod restored those tissues, separating the bones, restoring flexibility and getting rid of the pain.

2156,Instead of the botanical terps they use cannabis derived terpenes so the flavor is strain specific and also adds to the entourage effects from different strains my favorite is the pink açaí,2022-9
2157,"i’ve consistently brought mine into universal and horror nights for the past few years by just putting it in my bag. but be careful with the security dogs, they have a lot more this year. i got caught with mine because of a dog but all they did was toss the pod they let me keep the battery so no biggie",2022-9

2161,"I’m not much of an intellect when it comes to differences in wax, but I did get a solventless pod recently after experiencing distillate many a time before. You’ll certainly notice a difference in flavor; it tastes much more like weed. In addition, I think it’s a little smoother on the throat, and the high feels more ‘clean.’ Even tho I didn’t get more high than distillate, I felt more clear headed and less bogged down",2022-9
2162,Homie I smoke 2 1g stiiizy carts a week for the last 2 years without ever having any oil come up the top. That’s crazy is it that common?

It never leaves my house.,2022-9

2253,i notice the last one doesnt have a scratch off sticker and all the packing is different one says thc pods with premium above it and another says premium thc pod all im one line and no measurement on the box? doesnt say how many mg or oz same witg the cdt one somethings off here they all have different packaging,2022-9

2256,"i could be wrong im no expert but i kinda bounce around from different shops a lot of time so im always going to different shops and my stiiizy packaging is always the same. im like 90% sure stiiizy doesnt design different packaging it wouldn’t really make sense i dont think, so that is something that would definitely sus me out… ive also never seen a stiiizy box with the verification not in the right too corner that would be kind of a red flag for me. have you scanned all the barcodes yet tho? cause i know there is ways to fake the verification codes some people just assume their legit if they have the scratch off but sometimes you scan the scratch off and it says its been verified 2728329 times or whatever ya know. ive also been to shops that sold me a stiiizy woth no sticker at all and the packaging was their OG packaging before they upgraded the childlock system on their boxes… again i could be wrong things vary a lot state to state… buttt that would just be too many red flags for me",2022-9

2260,because i live in california so for my state that would raise a lot if red flags thats why i mentioned things vary state to state so theres no confusion you didn’t really clear anything up again you just repeated what i said and anyone can easily make fake stiiizy packaging in any state they want even stated that stiiizy isnt sold retail in its really not hard at all so where’s your evidence that theres no fake stiiizys in the states you listed?,2022-9

2262,i asked you to provide evidence for what you’re saying if im so wrong? i was speaking about my state specifically not in general so everything i said is true in california if you cant provide the proof to actually prove me wrong thats all you had to say,2022-9
2263,"i’ve been on this sub, the fake carts sub, and stiiizy legit check sub for almost 3 years(and seen damn near every post). not one fake stiiizy has every been posted from any state but california. you can even check all those chinese websites (alibaba, dhagte, etc) that sell fake carts/stiiizys, they will all be marked for cali. if you can link me one fake stiiizy not from california i’ll correct myself. until then, I haven’t seen it in 3 years and stiiizy only recently expanded to AZ and NV within that time. 

I’ve been buying stiiizys since they came out in 2017 in cali and followed them closely since. i’m extremely familiar and knowledgeable on this subject. this isn’t to come off as condescending or anything, it’s just annoying at this point",2022-9
2264,i personally would not take anything said or posted on reddit as fact or evidence there is so much misinformation spread online which is why i asked for you to provide some sort of anything to back up what youre saying but i still appreciate your input and just because something is marketed for california doesnt mean they cant ship it to a different address people can even ship from cali to other states not everything illegal is posted online so you cant just post a picture of a fake stiiizy and say yes heres my proof that theres a fake stiiizy in this state… it doesnt really mean or prove anything im confident that you are knowledgeable about this subject but just because you havent seen something doesnt mean it doesn’t exist. either way im not trying to argue with you despite what you might think simply trying to have a civil conversation which is what reddit is for i cant really do anything about the fact that you find it annoying to have to back up your info if you cant back it up or simply dont want to because it’s annoying i would suggest you just dont say anything at all but hey i dont like telling people what to do just a suggestion i hope we can just leave it at that cause again im not trying to argue but i dont mind going back and forth to have a civil conversation on disagreements im not sorry that you find that annoying,2022-9
2265,"jeez🤦‍♂️when I say marked for california it means in a CA! marked box. you can send that wherever you want, it’s still gonna have the CA! on the box.

lol, where’s any proof for your claims ?? I told you i’ve seen damn near ever single post on all major cart subs for the last 3 years. all the fake stiiizys posted have been CA! marked boxes. never one from another state. all of the ones available for sale online from the major fake cart sellers are all CA! marked boxes. go prove me wrong, find one fake that’s not a california marked box. I told you if you can i will correct myself and apologize. if you can’t prove they exist and there’s now evidence to support they do, why would you assume they exist? and it’s not like you’ve done any research on this clearly so why are you trynna speak on something you don’t fully know/understand ? THAT is what is annoying me lmao",2022-9
2266,"i see what you’re saying now i apologize i misread marked for marketed. the CA! sticker isnt even something i thought about ill admit that part, but here is what i do know in states wheres stiiizys arent sold legally people in other states will have people send them packaging and pods (full or empty, real or fake) from california. i know this because i have a friend in Oregon that does exactly that. im not gonna provide proof of that simply because im not gonna out that person for illegal activity so its up to you if you want to take my word for it or not but i will admit you are right about a lot of them being extremely prevalent in california but they do exist in other states even if they are marked for california im not gonna go do whole bunch of research on stickers from other states cause it honestly just doesnt matter to me that much but i do believe you when you say they are almost never seen from other states but they can be faked in california and shipped out to other states. especially in states where stiiizy isnt sold in shops people dont really care that it says CA! nor do they do know as much as we know since we are in a state that has so many resources for stiiizy we get more exposure to them. and again not everything is posted on reddit so just because you’ve been on a subreddit for 3 years doesnt mean you’ve seen every fake product to ever exist in every state, just because it not on reddit doesnt mean it doesn’t exist i personally think thats a silly excuse to say thats how you know they don’t exist my point wasn’t about the stickers being accurate to what state the fake product is actually in, just that they do exist in other states.",2022-9
2267,"yes I agree 100% that ppl send product out from cali on the regular(real and fake). i’ve seen pics of smoke shops all the way in NY with CA! marked product. but that’s my point it’s always cali marked stuff, legit never seen one from any other state. yea they could be out there but the odds of that with nobody posting abt them or being available on any of the major fake cart mfg sites is incredibly unlikely. everybody wants to buy weed from “cali” no one want to buy a product from arizona (or any other random state) which is why counterfeit california product is so prevalent compared to other states. 

side note: every state has their own unique warning symbol (except for like 2 that share one). the CA! is exclusive to cali and required for all cali product. if there isn’t one on the front, it’s not a legit product from cali. OP’s being from NV or AZ doesn’t require a warning symbol on the front hence why it’s missing. 

sorry for the rant but seems like this was a productive convo. a bit of miscommunication at the start but it seems cleared up now. cheers, have a good rest of your day 🤙🏼",2022-9

2271,If u email them they email u right back. Great customer service. Lol,2022-9
2272,I read they can fake the codes tho.. I scanned and it said authentic,2022-9
2273,Shouldn't they be able to scan the code only once? And after first scan the website should say.”Verified on 9/1/2022” Authentic Stiiizy product. Once the date is locked in everything after that date would and should NOT be Authentic,2022-9
2274,What did u exactly write to get them to send u merch? “Hey I bought a fake stizzzy” jw lol,2022-9
2275,Dang really? I find it nearly impossible to get through to them. Finding it a but frusturating at this point honestly haha,2022-9

2281,Lmfaoo tf is wrong with your supherb 😭😭 think u got the wrong batt there buddy,2022-9
2282,Honestly disappointing that a company as big as Stiiizy doesn't already have essential things like air conditioning for their work environment. Big L imo especially since they seem to be opening a lot of new locations recently.,2022-9
2283,"Ay I work at a stiiizy in the north bay, no complaints here. We're even unionized. They gave me a chance to be a budtender, even though I had no experience in this industry. I guess it varies from store to store, although I will agree that stiiizy can be very corporate.",2022-9

2288,shit ill take they job ..,2022-9
2289,That's is a comfortable temperature. You guys haven't obviously worked in construction or in a warehouse in the desert. 88°. Seriously. Trying working in 110° with the only time you're able to drink was on your break. If I was that month. I would have done the same thing.,2022-9

2293,"so…. why is it my job to make sure you can pay your bills? im struggling myself, to ask for tip for just giving me an item is actually so stupid maybe if you were a server yeah. Entitled asf LMFAO",2023-6
2294,How can I replace them?,2022-10
2295,Or a living wage where the workers don’t have to rely on tips.,2022-9
2296,"You should. Or be getting a ""living wage"" as a bud tendor. Jobs like these are suppose to help you get your foot in the job world and get experience in customer service or sales. That way you can go to another company that offers the "" living wage"". In California EVERYTHING is going up in prices. Go to school. Get a degree and make that money.  If I'm understanding this correctly. Most likely the location we are probably talking about is San Bernardino. I know because I got the call for A/c hvac. And they have A/C. It just went out. That was it. Next thing you could have done instead of walking out is bring ice water to work.",2022-9
2297,It was the san bernadino location,2022-9
2298,"We walk 4-9 miles a day because i serve 50-90 customers just me alone.  And in those humid hot conditions the product not only does get moldy. But our union considers these unsafe conditions.
And my store alone served 13000 customers in one week alone. We are in the middle of the ghetto and we do not even have our own parking on the site of the store. Ive almost been hit almost 3 times each month by a car.  So i don't think you have any fucking clue what you are talking about lmao.
Also there's no proper ventilation and its extremely dusty and can easily develop mold in the vents because we already had a problem with leaks during rain. 

But dont be a dick about a growing industry and a brand that aims to ""pioneer"" this field when they obviously can do better. 

Just because you want to risk your own health working over 100 degree conditions doesn't mean everyone else will. In california they do not force construction workers to work under this cali heat and most construction is done over night through 9pm-5 am. 

All i hear from construction workers and people who work with cars in this thread is that they dont care what conditions they work in as long as it pays enough. Anybody is willing to risk their bodies health.

Your body determines your industry. And if you are willing to make sacrifices for your health. Go for it.",2022-9
2299,[deleted],2022-9
2300,Don't they start people at like $20+/hr? Seems reasonable for a budtender to me....,2022-9
2301,Idk if it’s San Bernardino because it seems cool in there and no problems from budtenders I’ve talked to. On top of that there’s warehouse workers down the street unloading boxes inside 53 foot metal trailers in the sun and it’s going alright.,2022-9
2302,4-9 miles. How did you come up with that number. This must be your first job.,2022-9

2313,Both! Taste and high is equal. But yea taste . Watermelon jolly rancher,2022-9
2314,Watermelon Z and Orange Sunset are currently my go tos bc of the flavor and high they give,2022-9

2316,"Never had orange sunset either. Strawberry cough, mango cbd, sour diesel, blue burst, Pineapple Express, pineapple blast, and OG skywalker are my rotations lol.",2022-9
2317,"I've tried all the flavors at least once by now probably, but for some reason I like the fruity flavor both the pods give and mostly buy them when I go pickup. Definitely give Orange Sunset a try when you can, also recommend Blue Dream. Pineapple Express and Strawberry Cough are great so W rotation.",2022-9
2318,A dot of nail polish works! Or a scratch. I can usually tell which is which by the taste.,2022-9
2319,put the strain sticker on the box on your pods,2022-9

2328,"looks good, only way to know forsure is if you’re the sole verifier on the scratch and scan",2022-8
2329,Are you from California by any chance. I know most real pods have a CA sign on the mouthpiece.,2022-8

2333,nice,2022-8

2340,How high does one hit get you?,2022-8
2341,"I’ve absolutely loved them. They are everything I would want the live resin pods to be & more. I also just took a t-break and the effects are wonderful. 

So far, I’ve gotten Orange Sunrise, Blueberry Blast & PBJ and all have been fantastic. Just ordered a Rozay and it’s on its way. 

What’s your favorite so far?",2022-8
2342,How was PBJ? Im thinking of picking one up right now,2022-12
2343,Many people associate Sativa with more anxiety. So I would suggest you try some Indica dominate products/strains. So try not to use Hybrid or Sativa and see if Indica helps at all.,2022-8
2344,Cbd for sure then wrap in a cozy blanket and eat some cereal. Maybe watch half baked.,2022-9
2345,"embrace it, let the anxiety in.",2022-8
2346,I believe this is caused by too high THC and too low CBD in modern cannabis. I personally don’t like cbd pods because they taste a bit artificial. I’d recommend asking your dispo for the lowest thc and highest cbd flower they have (>1%). Also  excercise and bring anxiety levels down regardless of weed. Or honestly quit if it happens often.,2022-9
2347,"I feel like cdt is a better option as it at least had terpines. The og distilates are just Thc,cbd and synthetic food terps so it's literally the same effect on every pod. Anyone claiming different is experiencing a placebo effect.",2022-8

2350,SFV OG is fire,2022-8

Like in Cali you can only buy so many grams of wax at once",2022-8
2352,Need a plug,2022-8
2353,"It’s not the same effect , lmao I have smoked a pretty good amount of the og flavors if almost all and they do indeed smack different depending on which pod you have. Guess it depends on the person or tolerance",2022-8
2354,"Yeah I always wondered this, how many 1 gram carts can one person purchase per day at a stiiizy dispensary?",2022-8
2355,"It's not chemically possible. It's the two same compounds plus synthetic flavor terps in each batch.  It literally saids so on the box. 

Og pods are great if you want a cheap vape high but it's 100% placebo if you feel differences in og "" strains "".

For instance Skywalker og and blue dream are literally the same but with different synthetic flavorings. Everything eles is just marketing. 

If you go a step up into the cdt then you will get a more strain specific high due to the re introduction of terpines.

So why I don't doubt you feel a difference, it's merely a placebo effect. It's not chemically possible to really feel a differences as it is the same stripped down compounds in each vape.

If you think I'm wrong then I encourage you to look ot up on other sub reddits, online or even call them yourself.",2022-8
2356,"It’s been 8 for years, and 2oz flower I believe",2022-8
2357,No wonder my plug n play highs feel differentish.,2022-8
2358,What is the loop hole around this?,2022-8
2359,"Unless plug and play re introduces terpnies, it's the exact se as above.

That's why I stick to stiiizys cannabis derived terpine line. Really good stuff.

Nothing wrong with og pods, just like more variety in strain effects.",2022-8

Do people backdoor products like these.",2022-8

2363,"I got absolutely plowed off of one their live resin carts, and my tolerance is really high",2022-8
2364,How does this one differ from the others? Like the watermelon z and skywalker og? I’m a newbie,2022-8
2365,How much did you pay for this,2022-8
2366,"The different is the extraction method. The method that results in the distillate in og stiiizy pods has basically just only thc.

With live resin you flash freeze the plant right after you cut it from the soil. Basically you’re getting the essence of the “live” plant. Which is where the name comes from. The low temperature preserves all of the nice terps and Cannabinoids which is why those pods are so gas. I have a garlic mintz one I’m chief on right this second

Solventless is where you dont use butane or anything to extract it it’s a little like putting a nug between two hot plates and then sticking that into a pod. Have yet to try one yet",2022-8
2367,Looks fire,2022-8

2369,Not long enough,2022-8

2372,This is my first time tryna CDT it taste similar to live resin carts,2022-8
2373,You mean like your high was going away fast bc that’s what I’m feeling I’m only faded for about 30mins then it goes away,2022-8
2374,Yup it got dat earthy taste to it. The high is so much cleaner then the regular thc dissilate pods they got.,2022-8
2375,"ahh i mean flavor wise, it’s was more bland to me than other pods. the high to me was overall good though like any other CDT",2022-8
2376,The blue ones you have to wait at least 5 min between hits or you’ll burn the oil. Read the instructions lol,2022-8
2377,What are the blue packs,2022-8
2378,how the hell did u afford it! I envy you :O  What dispensary you go to? That much would cost me like 560$. seeing here they are like 40$ a half gram and like 50$ a full. DTLA is where I go,2022-9
2379,But doesn't one hit get you super high? Compared to the others.,2022-8
2380,they are half gram rosin pods :) so solventless   and like the comment above^ u gotta use the small battery it burns a lot easier,2022-8
2381,"Rosin and Live resin pods are hard to find in Phx,Arizona. The small battery is best for anything tbh. Big one is overkill or gotta hit it for 1 second 3 times let it cool down",2022-8
2382,"i love the big batt tho tbh    and yea im sure it is, i just got lucky bc i was in cali for the week!!",2022-8
2383,What did you pay? The cdt pods we have are 80$ with no medcard. That's like 30% tax included. 72 for a normal gram,2022-8
2384,"Yes. If you look on the back lower bottom it tells you how much THC and CBD it has. So the more THC the more high, hence the different highs😛",2022-8
2385,Picked up their set of new CDT strains from the DTLa shop a couple weeks ago. My fave of the batch is Jealousy. All are 🔥 tho,2022-8
2386,"Im not sure if stiiizy ever brings back the older cdt strains they had. I tried some last year that I don't see or find anymore, so in a way the cdt strains they have are always ""new"".",2022-8
2387,have jealousy currently ! super good!! but this white guava sounds amazing 😵‍💫😵‍💫,2022-8
2388,Dang I wish I grab this instead of jealousy! 😭😩,2022-8
2389,Damn homie how’s the jealousy? Is it more Indica or more sativa of a hybrid would u say?,2022-8
2390,It’s all good this one is no doubt amazing but I can’t wait to try jealousy too.,2022-8
2391,super good! smells super good and the taste is definitely there and earthy 😊,2022-8

2393,[deleted],2022-8
2394,"I’ll say this they’re all distillate and will literally affect you the same way. The taste will vary, Anything else you feel is placebo. CDT & Live Resin on the other hand, will give you a more true, flower high and taste. The smaller THC % leaves more room for actual terpenes that get you way more faded off a “smaller percent”",2022-8
2395,So good that I can't tell you cause I was so high,2022-8

The ones I've gotten at stiiizy have never done this.",2022-8

2446,Lmao they dont check??,2022-8
2447,"Usually the 1 gram pods fade off fairly easily. The half grams pods, those don't rub off at all.",2022-8
2448,orange sunset is so good. sometimes it hits me hard and makes me think it’s indica lol,2022-8
2449,Curious about the taste,2022-8

2459,Heard about that female basketball player got caught in Russia with carts? Read the laws of the country your going to my friend. Be careful.,2022-8
2460,Did you make that? Or is that some amazing stiiizy swag?,2022-8
2461,"That’s a lot of money. I went to Michigan and re upped for myself and I got 20 stiiizy CDT 1g pods, 5 element .5 carts live resin, 5 grams of concentrate. all that for $380 today it was a good deal on 7/10 at cookies.",2022-9
2462,"Stiiizy always had these deals threw the week . Nodal cdt cost $52 i think full gram and on certain days (check weedmaps for deals) they have pod deals for example where I purchase my pods full gram OG pods 5 for $200 flat and on Tuesday/ Wednesday they have the 4 full gram CDT pods for $180 flat which is $45 each which saves you some cash ! Always go for the deals, check ya weedmaps",2022-8
2463,Ummm that is 90 bucks per cart... You got ripped tf off.,2022-8
2464,"Not in arizona ,78$ for cdt",2022-8
2465,$360 vs $180. I saved $180. But ok pal,2022-8
2466,Damnnnn $78,2022-8
2467,I get the 1G CDT straight from Stizzy at $52,2022-8
2468,Damn. This is the dispensary as well. Dank grams go for 72-80$ here it sucks. That without tax. We don't have stiiizy stores here in PHX.,2022-8
2469,Michigan with med card - whole camo setup with 1 g card. 50 with 6 percent tax. I often see 6/100 for 1g pods at bigger names dispensaries,2022-8
2470,That probably because they just opened it in Michigan and will raise the prices once everyone's on them,2022-8
2471,"Yeah your Port is completely missing you can see the board in the back
 I'm sorry but you'll need a new one",2022-8
2472,"No it is not completely gone you have to slide out the black part at of the Stiiizy battery from the bottom right where that charging port is at, I used tweezers. The charging port is connected to that circuit board which has flipped over mine did the same thing and just fixed it",2022-8
2473,"Obviously fake how can you not tell 

/s",2022-8
2474,"Just strictly buy straight from stiiizy, can’t trust outside vendors because 1. The pod is always old as shit😂 
2. It’s more than likely to be fake.  

Enjoy!",2022-8
2475,Haven't had a stiiizy pod in a while but i believe the warning is bigger on the real ones?,2022-8
2476,Brother stop asking if it’s legitimate on the internet if it came in the box sealed and the scan works and it’s from a dispensary then it’s good if not vape at your own risk,2022-8
2477,I scanned the QR code and it said its real,2022-8
2478,wtf really?,2022-8
2479,Pretty crazy how many people have fake pods. I never bought a fake pods NOT once and I’m in NYC lol,2022-8
2480,wait but I scanned the qr code and it said its real,2022-8
2481,"Bro nobody can tell you through the internet

Just scan the QR code",2022-8
2482,Bro /s mean sarcasm if it scans on the real website then it’s good,2022-8
2483,"Same, I inspect the hell out of my pods if they come from a local dispensary and not stiiizy, but I try to always buy from stiiizy even for flower, edibles etc",2022-8
2484,I did and it scanned to the real thing,2022-8
2485,oh I dont know reddit lingo lol,2022-8

huh?",2022-8
2490,"No bro. I don’t think you can fake  brand new QR codes. I’ve had Stiiizy be scanned 10,000 plus times. I Stopped buying off street dealer after that and started to go to the dispensary for them.",2022-8

2492,A) nice B) THERES A SPRITE CRANBERRY SKIN??,2022-8
2493,Let me know how those cdts are! Trying them today after work but my nearest menu has only half grams.,2022-8
2494,Cdts are my go to. I prefer these over the live resin and it the og. I feel like these hit harder imo. Yeah definitely get the full gram they last longer,2022-8
2495,I feel the same way. What location did you hit? The ones I've gone to only ever have the lemon flavor or white durban.( I don't like indica).,2022-8
2496,Santa Rosa that location always has all types of strains,2022-8
2497,Half gram pods make the stiiizy battery look like big Ed 😂,2022-8
2498,"get a cdt pod, don’t get live resin or distillate holmes, they don’t last and don’t give you as well as they should for the price. for cdt the high is at least nice",2022-8

2500,"CDT Indica, no flavor = 🔥",2022-8
2501,Is that a new sticker or a providence/area specific sticker?,2022-8
2502,So are you an indica or sativa guy….?,2022-8
2503,"Agreed. Made the mistake of getting the OG Kush ""Rainbow Flavor"" pod last time, because on the menu it was only listed as OG Kush and didn't mention any rainbow.. Tasted weird as one would imagine cuz I mean wtf is ""rainbow flavor"" anyways..",2022-8
2504,"Mostly indica just because my nervous system tends to already be overactive as it is, and sativas just add fuel to that fire (anxiety, sweating, stomachaches, etc)! 

I usually go for a balanced hybrid or indica-leaning hybrid throughout the day, then heavy straight indica at night for sleep. 

Smoked flower for 15 years and whenever i tried cartridges I always thought they tasted like poison and my lungs were sending off red flags that it just wasn't good/clean stuff. But Stiiizy is legit, I only recently started using them and am a fam of the Cannabis Derived Terpene pods specifically versus the botannical terpene pods.",2022-8
2505,Have you tried solventless? I love my pink lemonade pod. Also rainbow kush live resin other than the taste.,2022-8
2506,"I would assume pretty soon they're missing that small niche in the market by not having the lr or solventless everywhere. With that said, I live near 2 stiiizy stores and none seem to have solventless pods since they released. They seem to stock up really slowly on lr and solventless pods",2022-8
2507,Bro the shop I goto recently restocked and I’m broke right now. Dang lol,2022-8
2508,"You aren’t missing much, their LR and solventless are bottom tier.",2022-8

2512,Shit how much they paying I’ll work for stiiizy 😂,2022-8
2513,I've had one out of four big batteries go bad. I always buy 3 batteries for whatever cart/pod I'm using.,2022-8
2514,I do the same 😂 and people always think I’m nuts. Especially for carts. But when I find a good cart battery since most suck I stick with it and get a couple in case I lose one or it goes bad. The one i use for carts now though is expensive it’s $80 but definitely worth it in my opinion.,2022-8
2515,which one do u have?? i’m looking for a new battery,2022-8
2516,"I have the pckt two. It’s the most advanced 510 battery I’ve found. It has battery indicator, haptic feedback, usb c. Variable volts , solid metal. Pass through charging. Can change the led indicator brightness and the haptic feedback strength. Battery is 660 mah which is one of the biggest I’ve seen for carts and it’s a nice size",2022-8
2517,"why do ppl keep asking this question to strangers on the internet? it's a simple way to figure it out. did you purchase the pod from an authorized stiiizy dealer? no? it's black market, vape at your own risk.",2022-8
2518,Did the QR code on the outside of the box verify? Or the serial number?,2022-8
2519,__ that’s dark my friend,2022-8
2520,"it wouldnt matter if it scanned real, its a refill with mystery oil. when there isnt oil covering the bottom of the rod it means it was recently filled.",2022-8
2521,"This confuses me

Are you saying stiizy barcodes can be tampered with to the point that you can scan it multiple times and it wont tell you its been scanned? Or are you saying people take the boxes, never scan, use the product, refill and resell?",2022-8
2522,"im saying it was a real pod from stiiizy, but the plug/middleman smoked it and refilled it with random oil. the packaging and hardware is legit so it would say its legit, but the oil itself isnt stiiizy oil.",2022-8
2523,How's the high of these,2022-8
2524,Do your pods feel loose in your biiig battery ? Got one today and tried a few pods and they feel a bit loose,2022-8
2525,Who tf is buying cbd pods?,2022-8
2526,How are they since its a 1:1 still decent amount of thc.,2022-8
2527,People who don’t like to be too fried all the time,2022-8
2528,It’s the drip of hot oil leaking out sometimes it happens,2022-8
2529,Try moderating how hard you're inhaling....imagine trying to gently pull the vapor from the pod rather than inhaling hard.,2022-8
2530,"Had an entire half of a 1G pod squirt out of the cart while on vaca out of state a couple days ago. It was supposed to last me the whole trip and ended up lasting like half a day after that

Sad times. Plus that shit hurt and tastes like ass",2022-8
2531,I do hit it gently and often throughout the day. I can't do power hits anyway. However my husband hits it harder than I do and never had this happen to him.,2022-8
2532,"Strange!  Do you tend to take hits back to back?  Like right after taking one hit you take a second a few seconds after? I had to stop doing that because I was experiencing something similar to you on the 2nd of back to back hits. It's annoying but now I try and give it 45-60 seconds in between hits to ""cool off"" and have been okay so far.",2022-8
2533,I got a couple pods the other day and today was deciding between the blue burst and the strawnana. Think ima go with strawnana first though lol. Enjoy!,2022-8
2534,"Blue burst makes me sleepy, its a nighttime strain",2022-8
2535,How much are the pods ?,2022-8
2536,I love the green green battery! Just curious; how much are you paying for pods?,2022-8
2537,"i love strawnana ! this is my first time w the blue burst, i like the flavor and that first hit had me so stoned",2022-8
2538,"usually around $60, less if you buy in bulk",2022-8
2539,In bulk ?? What does that mean,2022-8
2540,"I tried these for the first time last month. Mango half gram hit me way harder than I expected (although I do have a low tolerance). Suffice to say, these 1:1 pods certainly fit the bill.",2022-8
2541,"Been looking into these. How would you say the effects are? Compared to a normal stizzzy, do these get you way way less “high”? thanks a ton!",2022-8
2542,"I am so content with them. These are my 3rd round of them. I just love that they don’t have me so high I can’t function around normal people.
I guess I feel like I have more control over my high with these tbh",2022-8
2543,"I feel like I’m not one to smoke weed to help a headache because I feel like the dehydration from vaping/smoking just makes it worse so I never do. This seems to help with my chronic muscle pain in my shoulder remarkably and I can smoke a fair amount to help with that but at the same time I’m not like laid out- I’m still highly functioning.
I get really nervous in public situations but my husband indulges I’m very public things so I’m able to cope better with engagement because my anxiety and nervousness is decreased. I focus more (defiantly what I would vape and drive with) but at the same time I like just chillin and watching movies while feeling lifted off these too. I donno I’ve never been a huge advocate for cbd because it’s never really done me any justice in comparison to all the hype others bring to cbd but this was some of the first pods that I actually loved the benefits from. The mango has always been my favorite.
They are just perfect for me and my high functioning and active life style.
That reminds me to- HIKING. Such a good one for the hikes with out wasting away on my stamina 👍🏼",2022-8
2544,That’s a great way to describe the high. I feel the same way about it.,2022-8
2545,"the first 15 hits of Blue burst is like a delicious blue otter pop on a summers day. Which i do love. But overall the blue dream has less of a strong flavor so easier to smoke long term. 

I admit my favorite stiiizy pods are premium jack and pineapple express which both don’t have any flavor added in",2022-8
2546,I didn’t like Pineapple Express at all,2022-8
2547,A lot of people don’t like either of them because they say they taste like weed.,2022-8
2548,How you gonna like smoking weed but not like the taste of weed,2022-8
2549,Facts wtf😭,2022-9
2550,"Check on Etsy, even tiktok",2022-8
2551,i usually just put some small designs on them whether it’s a sticker or drawn shouldn’t be hard tbh you can find em anywhere,2022-8
2552,the fake flavored vapes are so nasty,2022-8
2553,Probably because you buy from black market dispensaries😂,2022-8
2554,"i buy from the stiiizy retailer near union station, they taste nasty and artificial",2022-8
2555,thats subjective and the purpose of the flavored ones is to taste artificial lol. there isnt weed that tastes like rainbow candy flavor or blueberries.,2022-8
2556,Yea they do the only way to go really are cdt and live resin (haven’t got my hands on a solventless blue box yet) there are a few strain specific og pods that are good none of the fruit shit will I even touch and as much as I do like true to the strain OG kush flavor the hardcore og I did not like. Sour diesel pretty good so is premium jack but like I said cdt LR is the way to go.,2022-8
2557,"agreed but in terms of regular carts, i stick with og kush, sfv og and king louis.",2022-8
2558,Also got blue burst I’m about to try next after my plug n play Girl Scout cookies.,2022-8
2559,[deleted],2022-8
2560,my fav cdt indica rn is doublemintz,2022-8

2562,"It’s good G but what you looking for our there Heavy Indicas Like Grand Daddy Purp and Purple Punch But my absolute Favorite Is Skywalker Og and King Louie

Edit: I also just finished trying all the Indica Strains of The regular Pods",2022-8
2563,Never had stiiizy Pineapple Express yet but I just finished plug n plays and it was amazing. Definitely give it a go for stiiizy,2022-8
2564,"i got pineapple express and og kush, whatd you think of the og kush ?",2022-8
2565,Same! I wish they had more 1:1 carts. I've tried cherry sunset CDT. Very much mellows me out as well,2022-8
2566,Bday cake,2022-8
2567,Did it make your heart race at all? That’s why i stick to the cbd ones,2022-8
2568,some advice: stop taking blinkers ur ruining your pods by overheating the metals inside which means you’re inhaling them.,2022-8
2569,Whaaaat blinkers are bad?! I’ve never heard that. Wouldn’t they be designed to blink BEFORE they’re overheating?,2022-8
2570,some people like to take blinkers and immediately remove the pod to let it cool off,2022-8
2571,"Oooh thanks for the info! I’ll try to avoid them and I like the idea of taking the pod out to cool if I do hit a blinker. 

Just curious, what’s your source for that info? And could stiiizy have improved by now? I love blinkers because I can easily quantify them and keep an eye on my tolerance/usage. But I love my lungs more!!",2022-9
2572,"it’s kind of just general knowledge, the coils get hot and at some point the metal melts which eventually merged with the oil, but if you’re looking for a source many youtubers like Erick Khan have made videos about it",2022-9
2573,Solventless 🤪,2022-8
2574,They stopped making them.,2022-8

2579,"if you look closely there’s a small qr code at the bottom right corner, try that, if it don’t work then idk",2022-8
2580,Been smoking stiiizys for about 2 years now. Love them cuz it's discrete unlike smoking flower. My breaks at work are super chill. No smell. Wish I lived in Cali though. Went to the stiiizy store for the first time when I visited and it was really cool to see all they got. Enjoy your stiiizys!,2022-8

2582,Og kush,2022-8
2583,"i actually just got my first stiiizy bat & pods a couple weeks ago, doublemintz, & wifi 43. the doublemintz so far is my favorite i can't wait to try more flavors. (also, recommendations anyone? getting a new haul this week)",2022-8
2584,"Enjoyed the White raspberry.. Def the bigger battery those lil ones are a waste of money 💴 
Enjoy",2022-8
2585,Do some pods have different atomizers? Cause usually the middle atomizer looks not as curvy as that one but I had one like this one the other day. Does anyone know if Stiiizy sometimes uses different hardware?,2022-8
2586,"It’s still distillate though, not putting that in my lungs",2022-9

2593,All I’m say is PNP taste like the carts I used to cop back in 2017,2022-8
2594,stiiizy is cheaper and has more options. plug n plays whole gimmick is hot hitting battery so theres extra vapor.,2022-7
2595,Can they make it any taller so I can just stand it on the floor and hit it!?!?,2022-7
2596,What the hell is that monstrosity.,2022-7
2597,"Honestly, just got to Cali yesterday as a long time pax user and after reading all about stiiizy and plugplay I came here jazzed to get my hands on full gram pods.  So I went and bought a plugplay setup and a justjack pod yesterday along with a pax pod.  The pax experience is just far and away the better option, taste, functionality, longevity, but yes, the plugplay slaps and gets you blasted, but it tastes like ass. Plug the battery is almost 30% bigger. The poster up there talking about the “hot hitting” battery is spot on, I was gonna buy a ton of these things but now ima pass. Maybe I’ll try stiiizy.",2022-9
2598,Lmao they most definitely Don’t. But whatever floats your boat,2022-8
2599,How u know what I was coppin in 2017 😂,2022-8
2600,Idgaf what u were coppin lol😂 plugnplay is good.,2022-8
2601,Is it supposed to bubble up like that?,2022-7
2602,Idk to me the small one is nice and discreet and after I heard the bigger batts burn more oil it made me wanna stick with the small one,2022-7
2603,Regular cause my biiig has disappeared in to the abyss,2022-7
2604,I only have the biiig battery so I may be a liiiiittle biased…,2022-7

2606,Biiig for home & regular for outdoors,2022-7
2607,Reg. Hate burnt pods,2022-7
2608,Regular. Big burns through the pods way too fast and depending on the strain sometimes I get waaaaaay too zooted after like 2/3 hits lol.,2022-7
2609,my boy got the stiiizy at the work site lol 🔥,2022-7
2610,I love the biiig but it’s burns my pods so quick. I keep it on hand but swap them out depending on if I want a huge rip or to be conservative.,2022-7
2611,"Although I do gotta say even though I prefer regular bat, I like biiig hits on occasion as the flavor profile is bomb af",2022-7
2612,i go with the regular because i use the portable battery case,2022-7
2613,Biiig ftw! Have the small one from the 4/20 box and don't really notice a difference. Need to do some science!,2022-7
2614,Stay with the small one I have 2 big ones and my pods just stay burning 😂,2022-7
2615,"I've tried and used both extensively and hands down I prefer the Biiig Stiiizy.  I know it uses more product, but I get the result I want in less time, LOL.  I very much prefer the Biiig over the standard size.",2022-7
2616,Anyone think white raspberry taste exactly like dosidos,2022-7
2617,You ever try the OG one? I started with the OG. I like the battery life and look of the biiig stiiizy but seems like it burns the oil quicker. How long does a pod last you?,2022-7
2618,"How come? Also a lot of people say the biiig burns the oil quicker , you think this is true?",2022-7
2619,Samee. That burnt taste is ass,2022-7
2620,"Noticed it burns too fast too. And same , I only had like a quarter pod left of og kush and both my regular batteries were dead so I used my biiig one and thank god I was home cause I got baked as shit from 4 or 5 hits.",2022-7
2621,That and it’s you ripped quicker with the biiig,2022-7
2622,You don’t think the biiig burns oil quicker ? Did you get one of those stiiizy holders in your 420 box? I want one of those lol,2022-7
2623,Definitely gets you higher quicker with less hits. You noticed too that it burns the oil quicker? I like the sleek size of the regular one but I love the look and light setup on the biiig stiiizy and of course the longer battery life.,2022-7
2624,Because I use the biiig stiiizy battery less,2022-7
2625,Its more voltage which means more power.,2022-7
2626,Yeah I’ve noticed I have a weird sore throat too if I use the big battery but that’s only with the distillate pods. The CDT & Live Resin are always good,2022-7
2627,"My carts have lasted about the same using them interchangeably . No holder, just the small battery, glass can, piece, papers, grinder lighter and cassette shaped speaker/battery pack . Yeah was so stoked with that box",2022-7

2629,[deleted],2022-8
2630,Where’d you get that stiiizy battery holder in the back? That’s dope as hell.,2022-7
2631,Some gas how’s the blunt I usually don’t like stiiizy flower shit seem weak to me,2022-7
2632,I hate NYC,2022-7
2633,damn those look like good flavors,2022-7
2634,They usually have them in dispensaries,2022-7
2635,How do you know this is from NYC,2022-7
2636,Never seen them. Is that plastic or glass?,2022-7
2637,It's not..... That's my problem Gee keep up,2022-7
2638,Not sure tbh bro never bought one before,2022-7
2639,"Sorry, what does NYC stand for?",2022-7

New York City we don't have a shop here",2022-7

2671,"Step 1: hit the pod until it’s warmed up. This makes the oil more liquid. 

Step 2: grab any used mask and rip the string off. Use this to tie around the “neck” of the pod. Make sure it’s tight on there or your pod is gonna fly out. 

Step 3: whip that shit (in a circle) 

Step 4: sit the pod upright and let the coil absorb more oil into the chamber 

Step 5: profit

*pics for reference 

Tips: a longer string will work better since longer radius = more centripetal force. Also this isn’t a trick for infinite oil. You can only do this about 3-4 times before you’re really out and start burning the coil.",2022-7

however it's had a lot of its issues. first of all, most people couldn't even play when it launched. no matter how good your connection is, there's still a handful of lag. & my biggest one of all, people are buying the standalone in game currency packs only to not get them in their account at all despite being charged for the money. i was one of these people, sent an email to support & still haven't gotten anything back yet; and if you look lots of people are having the same experience. i get that this is a beta but bruh...

do NOT buy it. if you wanna play, go on a streamers twitch stream playing MV, go afk 4 an hour & you're good. if you play & like the game enough, THEN buy cosmetic shit. hope this helps.",2022-7

2742,"Flavor and variety, friend! Stiiizy is respectably honest about what they’re selling you. Distillate is exactly that - flavored thc, not “weed” - think white claw flavors, it’s all the same flavorless malt liquor at the base. They’re insane to offer live resin and solventless on a pod platform without variable voltage and lower voltage options, but that’s besides the point for now. The entry level Stiiizy pods use botanically derived terpenes, which is a fancy way of saying “not from weed” - these are mixes of popular terpenes that exist naturally in weed, but from other (often synthetic) sources. These have no psychoactive qualities. One level up is their CDT line, which means cannabis derived terpenes. These are distillate with actual cannabis terpenes, which may bring on some degree of an “entourage effect.” They generally taste more true to a real flower strain. The old top dog was live resin, which is made by a solvent extraction of uncured, fresh then frozen flower. This has closer to the “full” high that smoking flower provides and is true to strain. They’ve recently put our solventless, which I haven’t tried but is made with solventless, as the name implies, extracted hash rosin.",2022-7

Pax is cool cause the battery indicator and variable temps and if you have the pro it has the app and usb c charging .

2851,"it could be idk i just found it, how could you tell the right one is empty?",2022-7
2852,honestly idk maybe try pressing it down on the battery to get it in there right if not u can still rip it the old charger wires way i think 🤣,2022-7
2853,Look at the oil around the coil and the side of the pod see how there’s a little around them. They were full at one point. Once you smoke enough of them it’s really easy to spot,2022-7
2854,"ohh thanks, yeahh i rarely get stiiizys haha So since the pod is still yellow is that oil? lmao It looks as if there’s oil on the perimeter",2022-7
2855,Yea and no there’s still oil in there but it looks old that’s why your pod stained like that. But it’s no good I mean unless you like smoking metal,2022-7

2859,cdts better,2022-7
2860,"I hate disposables in general but it was the cheapest way to try stiiizy without having to drop $20 on a battery, it smacked, battery didn’t die on me before the oil ran out which was my only concern. I got my battery now though and I’m looking for deals on pods near me",2022-7
2861,Any specific strains you prefer?,2022-7
2862,"I used to be like this, but i figured out its all a mental thing, i overcame it and still smoke daily. Also some people just generally need thc to have a appetite or fight insomnia",2022-7

Stiiizy isn’t unique to this 😂😂",2022-7
2864,"I mean i use it for medical reasons, ive lost 10 pounds in a week cause i couldnt eat, stiiizy makes it so im not nauseous. also insomnia runs in the fam 🥵",2022-7
2865,It isn’t mental at all. Daily use will clog your cannabinoid receptors causing your body to forget how to function when your not high. Eating and sleeping are the most effected areas of the body. If you don’t clear those receptors and or try to clear them it can result in Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome or just a really broken state of health,2022-7

2877,the dark color is normal for stiiizy live resin. could be an older pod that’s why it tastes off or bc the stiiizy battery runs too hot for live resin,2022-7

2965,whoever said that has no clue what they’re talking abt bc that’s completely false. that would defeat the whole purpose of the verification system. if it’s scanned more than once it’s almost always fake. only exception is when stiiizys system glitches and shows one or two previous scans in the future not hundreds or thousands,2022-7

2968,"well the “employee” is 100% wrong. if yours was scanned thousands of times, unfortunately it’s a counterfeit as well. any pod you buy from a licensed dispo will verify for the first time. counterfeiters reuse legit codes which adds up quickly, hence the thousands of scans",2022-7

wdym coincidentally replicated in counterfeit ? that means it’s fake lol. this isn’t a hard concept, we know forsure it’s fake",2022-7
2973,[deleted],2022-7
2974,"yea that’s why genuine stiiizys will verify for the first time, anything more and it’s a counterfeit bc it’s been copied, like you said. every pod has its own unique code, they aren’t all using one code for the same batch. 

the three III’s on the pod have not been used since late 2019/early 2020 at the latest, this claims to be made this year. since then they’ve been using the word “stiiizy” where they were. if you don’t know this it’s bc you haven’t bought a legit stiiizy pod from a licensed dispo in years or at all which is pretty clear at this point. 

and again you’re wrong on your last point. California didn’t start requiring CA! warnings on the carts and pods till late 2019/start of 2020, look this up before you respond. i’ve been buying stiiizys since the company started dude, this is 100% fake. if you keep pushing this you will be temp banned for pushing/encouraging use of fakes as legit product",2022-7

3066,Strawnana tastes like teriyaki beef jerkey from the gas station,2022-7
3067,What’s ur go to pod?,2022-7
3068,__🤣,2022-7
3069,Nice. I do the same at Padres games.,2022-6
3070,Always tough to get blasted and have your team lose but still a fun time at the park 🤣,2022-6
3071,Nice to see another Stiiizy fan at Citi Field. West coast pickups?,2022-6
3072,Stizzzo at an East Coast stadium.. legend!,2022-6
3073,Bro I am with you 1 million percent I did that shit the entire last season go Mets please don't kill me 😂,2022-6
3074,Haha best part is no one knows what’s going on 🤣,2022-6
3075,"On the real, buy Detox synthetic urine from ur local headshop. 

I have used this for my last 4 piss tests for jobs and I passed all perfectly and it was tested at a giant hospital also. 

It’s called “Quick Fix Detox synthetic urine” lemme Google for u

Edit: there main site is called “urineluck.com” 
That’s the main site for the “Quick Fix” synthetic urine that will pass every single test.

Your welcome",2022-7
3076,Yessir that’s the winner. I’ve used it 3 times passed no issues,2022-7
3077,Thanks for the story and information behind this shitpost,2022-6
3078,[deleted],2022-6
3079,I had a conspiracy theory that my heart pains are because of something in stiiizy pods. But I can’t prove it so 🤷🏼‍♂️,2022-6
3080,"I wasn’t super impressed, I kept mine sealed for less than 2 weeks + they were in my humidity controlled safe and they were fairly chewy/stale. Felt noticeably weaker than 10mg of the Friendly Farms strain specific LR gummies. Don’t love the container either, it’s sort of an odd design with the thick glass despite getting stale so quickly. Not terrible by any means and I love that we’re getting more options on the market for non-distillate edibles from major players!",2022-6
3081,Idk what a “weed hangover” is. What does that feel like?,2022-6
3082,"Tired, lethargic, and a foggy mind",2022-6
3083,That's my all time favorite,2022-6
3084,I can agree with absolutely everything here but I really did feel a better high with these pods,2022-6
3085,"The high is very nice. My issue is that it's not much better than CDT for the price. Also, the argument of solventless being healthier is bunk.  Both products go through purification.

Having said that, I believe stiiizy is on to something. If they can release a variable battery, solvenless will easily be my favorite line.",2022-6
3086,"I have to diss agree again, CDT does not hit like these so, either you’re hitting it wrong or you’re just very sensitive to that scale of product bc they don’t affect me like that.",2022-6
3087,"Stiiizy is my preferred choice as well. I’ve tried many many 510 cartridges and there’s just something about the Stiiizy oil that doesn’t mess with my lungs or throat. Plus the price point is great in California and you can’t beat the ease of portability, lack of smell, and awesome flavors. I can literally hit this thing anywhere I want and no one will ever know.",2022-6
3088,"I know this doesn't answer your question but I started out using 510's. Always gave me chest pain and would mess up my throat bad.
Stiiizy popped up on Eaze one day, I was curious and yeah I will never trade my Stiiizy.
So smooth, convient, affordable...I could go on. I haven't tried the CDT pods yet so just waiting for my next re up.",2022-6
3089,I fw stiiizys heavy but alot of ppl I know who smokin stiiizy starting to slowly faze out and switch to plugnplays. I personally fuck with both though,2022-6
3090,I don't totally understand your question. But I do love stiiizy. It is the cartridge brand that I will use.,2022-6
3091,"stiiizy are good. I would say the only comparable pods that may be better are Pax. for instance, Jetty makes good resin for pax pods",2022-6
3092,"So I’ve been using the stizzy for almost a year now and well I’m gonna be honest it’s the best fit for me, smooth yet relaxed high, some hit heavy and once the moment of high hits it’s so nice, I’ve had some other brand carts that just don’t hit the same and always give me throat burns and they all either taste like oil or something bad, and the flavored ones ain’t the same like stizzy pods,
And it’s so great that I can take it to places that have metal detectors and still be able to get high, and not only that but they don’t break easily like puffin carts/disposable and the look of it just looks slick, and clean",2022-6
3093,"I worked for stiiizy and saw the harvest info for pods and shit. Honestly, any other brand is superior. Stiiizy uses bottom of the barrel trim and shake to make distillate. Their prerolls are a mix of flower. The 40s Aren’t live resin, they’re clearly distillate. Trash ass overhyped company if you do your research.",2022-6
3094,I know exactly what ur saying dude. Yes. 💯 percent Dude. These feel different and better then 510 threads or anything I’ve tried,2022-6
3095,"honestly i think stiiizy is mid compared to raw garden, buddies, coldfire, and cannabiotix carts. i hate stiiizys normal line of pods, they really mess with my lungs and give me headaches.",2022-6
3096,[removed],2022-6
3097,This is the gas I need! I thought it was in my head but hearing stories like these is validating haha.,2022-6
3098,PlugPlay re adds cannabinoids to their distillate which makes them a far superior product and brand. Stiiizys distillate is bare bones and offers no real entourage effect besides a botanical flavor.,2022-6
3099,Is a plug-in-play just one of those batteries you can attach anything to?,2022-6
3100,"Ay that’s why I’m posting here is to hear information like that as well. I wouldn’t say that’s exclusively stiiizy, who do you recommend? Thanks for the reply with useful information",2022-6
3101,Interesting. That’s how my body reacts to other pods that aren’t Stiiizy. I’ve heard two Raw Garden recs.,2022-6
3102,[deleted],2022-6
3103,Do they run at a similar price point??,2022-6
3104,How much are the pax pods in los angeles??,2022-6
3105,Depends where ur at. Usually they run anywhere between $40-60 in Cali. It’s been hard as fuck to get plugs from what I hear tho,2022-6
3106,I’ll keep my eyes peeled and check ‘em out. Similar pricing to Stiiizy. I just wanna be more conscious instead of inhaling whatever is out in front of me since I’m turning into an old stoner now haha. Lung health baby,2022-6
3107,Anyone want to break down this flav? Looks dank,2022-6
3108,"Just finished mine 😭, I still got an unopened half gram watermelon z and purple punch I just opened this morning, puffin on skywalker rove cart",2022-6
3109,How does this taste my guy,2022-7
3110,"just realized my cart doesn’t have the ca logo even though it’s on the package, is my shit fake?",2022-7
3111,"Personally, it tastes like standard watermelon candy. Think of jolly ranchers but not as sweet. Very tasty, one of my favorites next to Pineapple Express 🤤",2022-6
3112,rove? save your lungs brother,2022-6
3113,Gets u hella smacked too Indica,2022-7
3114,Effect? Is this a Indica,2022-6
3115,"What’d up with em? I kind like em, I find PNP being too harsh, they get you smacked I can’t go longer than 4 seconds on a PNP",2022-6
3116,What Strain? Got me Purple Zkittlez CDT Pod rn! Happy Toking!,2022-6
3117,"How do the CDT hit vs the regular pods? Also, love that battery it’s become my go to as well lol.",2022-6
3118,My FTP bat is so fucked lol I daily used it for tooo long now it looks like shit😭😂 back in the box it went,2022-6
3119,"I got cherry sunset testing at the high 90% hybrid of course, but always will be a sativa head 🍻🙏
Happy toking",2022-6
3120,The CDTS have more of a punch to them in my opinion I haven’t gone back to a normal stiiizy wax strain in a while but all their wax’s are fair to in quality taste n high in a fair perspective,2022-6
3121,I’ve maintained my battery with care even with consistently buying pods weekly but I can say the graphic feels thin being a matte finish,2022-6
3122," for me its watermelon z. It's nice n fruity, it's an indica so you'll relax and be nice and chill, hopes things get better for you",2022-6
3123,"Distillate is distillate, indica/sativa dont exist. Its all just different terpene blends",2022-6
3124,Terpene blends are more important than indica/sativa for effects but the oils are still taken from flower,2022-6
