1,Take some rubbing alcohol and a plastic scraper or credit card and get it off! I wouldn’t want nail glue heating with the cart and seeping into my mouth lol,2023年6
2,GURL YOU GOTTA TRY PLUG PLAY SO MUCH BETTER.,2023年6
3,All the internals look fine. You just have to deal with your lips on a fucked up surface. Unless maybe you sand it 🤷🏽‍♂️,2023年6
4,Just chip it off?,2023年6
5,Maybe u need a tolerance break.,2023年6
6,Do you have an empty same sized pod? You can pull the mouth piece off. It's easiest with a plier. Then switch them and put the new one on.,2023年6
7,☕️,2023年6
8,99% iso u can try or id just use it if its not on any components that get hot and you dont get a bad taste otherwise toss,2023年6
9,if u have any old empty pods u can probably swap the cap,2023年6
10,Makes me Wanna try plugplay!,2023年6
11,Acetone will take it off babe!! Just don’t scrub too hard and be careful with your nails<3,2023年6
12,eh i mean slightly better but not like rosin vs distillate better or anything. by me its not worth the extra per but i know Cali has them for around the same price as the Stiizy i believe so it prob is there,2023年6
13,"Plugplay is better, coldfire is the best imo💯🔥",2023年6
14,I tried but it won’t come off smh,2023年6
15,"imo plugnplay has better distillate then stizzy yea it’s not rosin ofc, but the flavor and high is way better",2023年6
16,"Yes same price pretty much! I'm in CA. The battery is way better than Stiiizy, pods last longer and taste great. I'd definitely recommend it. Their live resin pods are fantastic as well. For distillate their stuff HITS.",2023年6
17,"Probably not what you wanna hear, but what does that mouth do? 

I'd be hard pressed to think youbwouldnt be able to use your teeth to somehow get it off then spit it out",2023年6

22,La Confidential deserves to disappear. It sucks,2023年6
23,They are both fire but I always go back to LA Confidential. Lmk what you end up getting.,2023年6
24,How often do you hit it?,2023年6
25,Start using that little rubber cap that they give you it won't leak that way or shoot hot oil,2023年6
26,Your paying way too much though it’s cheaper on the website that same kit is only $25 on the website !!,2023年6
27,"Looks good dude , personally you kinda paid alot like these other ppl mentioned , but all good I guess aslong it’s real right ? Anyway next I suggest look for them in any cbd sure they should ship them I think like 20-30 bucks for the same thing pop and a battery starter pack . Or like each pop for 13 a pop if I remember correctly . I been hearing too x-blend version is pretty nice and danky haven’t tried it yet but will soon .  Compared to og pod and they og line pods do they get you high . Even if a little",2023年6
28,do u smoke thc? What’s the high like on these?,2023年6
29,no known fakes of stiiizys hemp line. everything looks good,2023年6
30,It’s legit. Gelato is my favorite so far. Got that gassy funk I love.,2023年6
31,My god it legit,2023年6
32,What is Stiizy Hemp? Is it like a THCA version? I don’t understand how else they could sell them online to everyone?,2023年6
33,I think thats just the battery though right? This comes with a 1g pod and battery for 50 i think is a good price,2023年6
34,Fuck that hurts but fuck it it’s real. I gave the shop props too because they had great prices on pre rolls and other crap lol,2023年6
35,Thanks for the recs!,2023年6
36,yeah. it's been pretty calm for me. makes my eyes heavy but last time i took some heavier pulls and i was sleepy but giggling at dumb stuff. but it's calm,2023年6
37,whod fake a non THC product? nvm immediately after typing that im realizing some aholes looking to make extra money definitely would if it worked well for em,2023年6
38,I was looking for that one but the shop had limited flavors. Gelato was amazing when I smoked the flower.,2023年6
39,Nope the battery and the pod is $25 on their site,2023年6
40,It doesnt let me buy pods on their site and im in California. It says weed vape pen and battery for 20 but in the description it says pods sold separately. Did you buy from their site?,2023年6
41,Are you on the stiizy hemp site or the normal site? They are separate.,2023年6
42,Oh ok gotcha thanks haha,2023年6
43,What is Stiizy Hemp? Is it like a THCA version? I don’t understand how else they could sell them online to everyone?,2023年6
44,It’s okay!! I’m glad I was able to tell you I did the Same thing went to my smoke shop because I didn’t want to wait the shipping but then I was like fuck I might as well go online loll they also have a coupon code so anything over $50 use the code INSIDER10 and get 10 off and free shipping I really want to try the blunts,2023年6
45,"Because hemp is still legal in all the United States  you will hear names like HHC, CBD, THCA it’s all  a substance that comes off the weed plants it doesn’t get you as much of a body high it’s just going to give you those same feelings as if you were smoking actually delta9 (regular THC WEED ) all of the substances the weed plant has to offer! It’s actually not that bad I’m from Texas so I can’t get actually dispensary weed but I can get other legal hemp products and honestly
It’s basically just a loop hole for the government to make more money off us and still sell it as not actually “weed” 💚",2023年6
46,get their new 1g disposable if it’s available around you. the 1g one is rechargeable,2023年6
47,plus its live resin not just thc distillate so hits better too (imo),2023年6
48,The disposables are all distillate.,2023年6
49,maybe he’s thinking of the delta 8/hhc/x blend ones?,2023年6
50,"you’re good

51,lmaooo I scanned my pods out of pure curiosity and they were coming back as invalid even though one of them had previously scanned fine and I was about to hit up the plug good thing I saw this 😂😂,2023年6
52,stiiizy uploaded multiple times on their ig this past week they having authentication problems again w/ their qr codes.... happens at least once a year at this point. hopeflly they fix it.,2023年6

57,I posted a picture of me warming one up in the ac slots in the subaru sub and I got flamed. Wasn't even driving.,2023年6
58,Great minds think alike,2023年6
59,why would you warm it up via the heater?,2023年6
60,In cold months the wax gets harder and can clog,2023年6
61,no. the pod can go either way in the battery,2023年6
62,"This is such a genuine question. I love it. I’ll say, match the stiiizy logo to the battery you got. So you got two stiiizy logos on the same side. That’s how I do it. But yes, it is interchangeable.",2023年6
63,why is it harder to take a hit though sometimes when the pod is facing a certain direction?,2023年6
64,why is it harder to take a hit though sometimes when the pod is facing a certain direction?,2023年6
65,"might be placebo effect. pod is clogged due to other reasons (climate, altitude, etc) and you’re attributing it to the way it’s facing. try taking the pod out of the battery and taking dry pulls before you hit it",2023年6
66,Cause you’re too lit and hitting that battery so much and not clearing with a cap. That left over smoke solidifies and clogs it. Just like a bong you don’t clear leaving residue.,2023年6
67,nah but it’s only hard when it’s facing that certain direction like i’m able to take hits easily if i flip the pod around,2023年6
68,Pineapple Runtz is phenomenal,2023年6
69,That runtz is 🔥,2023年6
70,Pineapple runtz is amazing but my favs are king louis and gelato,2023年6
71,Pineapple Runtz is my jam. Going on my second one right now.,2023年6
72,Pink açaí is fire i don’t like pineapple runtz as much but still decent compared to most,2023年6
73,"Pink Acai is always sold out when i go. It's my favorite. The pinapple runtz is okay, every time ive received a bogo they give the pinapple runtz free.",2023年6
74,Got pink açaí rn🔥🔥,2023年6
75,How’s pink acai,2023年6
76,"Idk bruh pink acai was not it at all like idk. Shit was a big ass let down , got it from a legit dispo greenstone in Cali . Pineapple runts smacks though definitely hands down one of the new best",2023年6
77,Definitely a fav of mines,2023年6
78,Damn lucky,2023年6
79,"Personally, I love it. The highs are great, and it tastes very good. On the sweeter side",2023年6
80,What was wrong with Pink Acai? Smacks for me and this is my 3rd time getting it. Each time it was as good as before,2023年6
81,"I don’t know honest , the day I got it . It was very suttle flavor I get my stuff from a legit dispo so that was odd . Every other flavor I get tasted very dominant. But this one was odd like off to me .",2023年6
82,take a lighter to it and it will work a bit  more,2023年6
83,yes,2023年6
84,RIP,2023年6

90,Heck yeah there's lots left you just got to suck that thing like the cure for cancer is at the bottom.,2023年6
91,A,2023年6
92,What’s wrong with it?,2023年6
93,lol it’s done bud. Just enjoy rest but every hit it’s gonna waste like 3 more hits worth sucked in to the sides and bottom smh. I love stiiizys but a lot of them been messing up like this. I been using plug and play and regular carts. Plug plays never do this. Watermelon z stiiizy my fav stizz though smh.But If you got it at dispo go exchange it.,2023年6
94,Context would help bud.,2023年6
95,Never ever ever leave it anywhere in your car. Maybe if you live in like Vermont but 99 percent of the time I’ve seen friends leave their stiiizy in the car on a normal day and they come back and it’s ruined. Also never leave it in direct sunlight for long periods of time that will super heat the oil and mess up your pod real quick.,2023年6
96,"Is it the pink acai flavor?

You can dab it if you can’t return it…. Or trash",2023年6
97,If it’s been less than 7 days the dispensary will offer to exchange it for you. Call and ask them about their policy.,2023年6
98,The fluid leaks out of the main chamber into the sides. Not sure if it's a clogging issue,2023年6
99,"Yo I get what happened now. It happens most with the watermelon one from what I've experienced. But it can happen with any cart. Just don't leave it upside down or sideways in your pocket. Always have it upright and it won't clog or leak. Also, just know pocket heat can make it fluid and thin enough to move around in the cart.",2023年6
100,I keep one in the center console of my car (my drive home from work celebratory cart) and have never had a problem and my car sits out in the sun all day. I always keep it upright though.,2023年6
101,This has been happening  to me too when i have it my pocket but its only been the past year… the other 4 years I never had this problem and i had worked in warehouse that would reach high 90s during the summer,2023年6
102,Stiiizy really is the best recently tried turn and plug and play and I still return to stiiizy as my daily,2023年6
103,Not until you get a special edition battery.,2023年6
104,what special editions are there besides the camo and FTP?,2023年6
105,They had the 818 also and few others ones. You just gotta keep and eye out.,2023年6
106,Throw the pod(s) in your toiletries bag and throw your battery in another pocket of your bookbag or something. You'll be good.,2023年6
107,Stiiizy is trash,2023年6
108,you don’t gotta do all that even. just scratch off the CA weed logo and ur good that’s just a nic vape they don’t care abt it,2023年6
109,Girl I promise you will be okay put in your makeup bag! I’m sending you good energy ✨✨✨,2023年6
110,Your pocket is fine,2023年6
111,"brought some pods to st martin last month. threw them inside some rolled
up socks 🙌🏼",2023年6
112,Only put the battery with your carry on it’s what TSA says for rechargeable batteries. Then the pods should be fine just with your tooth paste or whatever really I usually keep mine with my carry on tho.,2023年6
113,I have carried mine from CA to Hawaii a couple times no worries. Just taking it on my carry on,2023年6
114,Some Solventess to Hawaii is worth risking a couple felonies,2023年6
115,i’ve traveled many times with stiiizy pods and never had an issue leaving it in my carry-on. i would separate the battery from the pod and put them in separate places in ur luggage,2023年6
116,in your pocket,2023年6
117,I usually put mine in my bra.,2023年6
118,Buy a cheap Walmart wallet that fits your battery and pod inside the pockets or sum. Like a trifold Velcro wallet. Then just take that out and put it in the bucket w your phone and keys,2023年6
119,Sharpie can fix that issue real quick lol,2023年6
120,"Wear some crew socks, hide it their. Worked for me dozens of times",2023年6

124,fake. super outdated packaging yet claims to be made in 2022. batch id reads incorrectly and it’s missing the CA! warning on the mouthpiece of the disposable,2023年6
125,They sale this 80$ in eu,2023年6
126,you got ripped off by so much,2023年6
127,LMAOO RIP,2023年6
128,How do you like it!! Is the taste good,2023年6
129,Did you still feel high or just mellow ?,2023年6
130,"pretty good high off it, taste is a lot like watermelon sour patch",2023年6
131,They just came out with 2 Gram pods now! Only $25,2023年6
132,"disposable, not pod",2023年6
133,No they didn’t 💀 that’s some boof shit,2023年6
134,"Nah, probably confused em w the disposables on their website, which are 2 grams and are $25",2023年6
135,2 gram for $25 how tf,2023年6
136,Wish Stiiizy would legitimately sell in NYC already 😒,2023年6
137,Wym scan ? Don’t you gotta scratch off the things to revel the barcode then scan ? Like the pods what I’m referring too idk about the blunt packs . Honestly dude if it’s to good to be true cause it is . Nyc don’t sell legitimate stiiizy products yet . I live in nyc myself and i have a plug who gets stiiizy and plug play and others that I can be sure they legit . I had smoked cali stiiizy straight from dispensary when I go there and obviously the cali ones scans are 100% verified and these nyc ones I get from my plug aswell i buy pods off him and his pods scan legit . So then I saw some in a smoke shop not even dispensary a normal smoke shop had stiiizy got curious and bought one paid $70 and didn’t scan like it wasn’t verified I went back and got my money,2023年6
138,"Are you sure it wasn’t stiizy hemp they just came out with!! If so it’s legit stiizy just hemp 

Check out stiizyhemp.com",2023年6
139,"The corner smoke shop on 61st and Lexington Avenue is selling boof stiiizy as well. Scanned 4 all busts. The guy behind counter played dumb as best he could. 

The smoke shop on 61st and 1st Ave sometimes has real Stiiizy.... It's a hit or miss. 

Some places in Brooklyn have real ones.... But they are $65. 😒",2023年6
140,"Facts. 

Tired of overpaying for bullshit.",2023年6
141,"Scan right in the store before buying. That's what I do. 

If they don't allow it, they are selling boof. And they know it.",2023年6
142,All of them have the label behind,2023年6
143,"you’re good, verification checks out",2023年6
144,i know but still feel like fakes can verify these days ya never know,2023年6
145,yeah i agree they can prolly fake verify . and that label behind the main one is kinda weird 🤔. but for future references take pictures of the pod under the pod and then take a picture of the little “metal rod” that is inside the pod .,2023年6
146,"you’re good, these just came out. that’s just a glitch in their system, one they’ve had on and off for awhile now",2023年6
147,how is the all in one? can you refill it? what do you do when you’re done with it?,2023年6
148,glad u said this or i would have said an amazing fake prob with the serial codes giving errors. Now i know 😊! did they make any claims suggesting when it should be fixed?,2023年6
149,"throw it out 😂 i think the battery is permanently attached for these. either way ur tossing the pod tho, id NEVER recommend refilling ANY Stiizy Pods as the coils are only meant for one life cycle or 1gram, itl start tasting bad and just not hitting after awhile",2023年6
150,Hey guys so update I ended up taking a needle from a sowing kit and popped the top of the cart and fix the wiring,2023年6
151,"Take a q tip with rubbing alcohol and don’t drench the q tip just a little bit and clean the inside of the battery, I had that happen sometime it can be a dirty in the battery part and then once you clean it should work perfect.",2023年6
152,Flip the pod around 180,2023年6
153,Try flip ping it around.,2023年6
154,Or just try to clean the inside battery as much as you can if you are on vacation and don’t rubbing alcohol just use a little bit of water on the q tip and clean the battery inside and then dry it with dry part of the q tip,2023年6
155,"Let
Me know if it works!",2023年6
156,take the black bottom piece of pod out and clean the connectors,2023年6
157,Take it back to your stiiizy store and swap it out. They have a 7 day return policy,2023年6
158,"This happened to me yesterday, I tried EVERYTHING, but no luck, gonna call my dispo to get it switched. Gonna start hitting my pods as soon as I walk out the door lmao",2023年6
159,"This happened to my bf last week, took it back to stizzy and the manager said to flip the pod around and it started working after that! The “CA!” Logo on the pod has to be facing the same direction the “stizzy” logo on your battery, he said!",2023年6
160,Yea I figured it out my self when I came home once and had the same issue I was so mad it wouldn’t work,2023年6
161,What if my pod dosnt say ca,2023年6
162,"They fade away during use i guess, but if its brand new, GG",2023年6
163,Alternative cannabinoids are legal in most of the 50 states .. xblend is 100% Altnoids you are not going to get in trouble.,2023年6
164,Out of the 3 alternative which is better,2023年6
165,[removed],2023年6
166,you cannot get in trouble.,2023年6
167,You can order it! It’s legal weed,2023年6
168,I have ordered 3 times on the stiizy website and I live in Texas where weed isn’t allowed,2023年6
169,"yes, it does ship to my state. lab results say there is .292 d9 and .3 is the legal limit. it’s on the hemp site, and it says thc is not detected.",2023年6
170,If it’s the crap d8 and hemp blends (which it is) you’ll be fine ordering it regardless of what state you live in.,2023年6
171,"I’m smoking this rn, it was the only hybrid cart in stock. Not too bad, a little too sweet.",2023年6
172,You dont like the high?,2023年6
173,Does this happen when the pod is new?,2023年6
174,sometimes yeah,2023年6
175,"I've been having a lot of issues with Stiiizy products lately, and I even purchased from an actual Stiiizy location and same issue. Not the same problem tho.

To prevent clogging, I always slide the pod out of the battery as I finish each hit, to ""clear"" it. I learned this when I put the rubber cap on top and saw a little puff come out the side vent, and it's helped tremendously.

But the last 8 pods I've gotten aren't clogged or leaking...just not hitting right. Straight burning the coil. Wicks aren't drawing the distillate up.",2023年6
176,"the thing is, i do the exact same ""clearing"" method. i've just gotten more discouraged to use it considering that it feels like nothing i do, no matter how many precautions i take, i still have trouble with the hardware. maybe it's still me doing something wrong but im doubting that more as time goes by & i use my stiiizy(s) more",2023年6
177,I've switched to PNP over the last month and it's been alright but I miss how my Stiiizy CDT was last year and before. Not a big fan of most carts either. Before this massive drop in quality I really considered them the most reliable/consistent experience.,2023年6
178,"highly agree on the last statement, been trying everything to stop myself from getting rid of all my stiiizy stuff.

i would switch to PNP, however it's not in my state. for the time being i've switched to live resin 510 carts & it just makes me wish i had stiiizys live resin + solventless pods (also not in my state lol)",2023年6
179,That’s so dope and cute😂🙏🏿,2023年6
180,Might not taste great; but you can get a couple puffs outta that,2023年6
181,Only one way to find out,2023年6
182,Yes for sure I get my pods way lower then that😂,2023年6
183,Heck yeah there's a lot of good smoke in there.,2023年6
184,Is that the rose gold battery?,2023年6
185,Passed on this flavor for the Apple Fritter CDT probably gonna have to try this one,2023年6
186,I have an unopened one I’m waiting to try. Finishing off a Strawberry Shortcake CDT first. I enjoy that one quiet a bit.,2023年6
187,"i also love apple fritter … i  this case i actually prefer the premium apple fritter sometimes cuz i like the apple terp flavor that they add. But the fritter  cdt is nice too. Def recommend this one. It’s like a nice regular weed flavor, doesn’t taste fake at all. really nice and mellow.. great for before bed!",2023年6
188,that sounds lovely… i don’t think I’ve had the pleasure of trying that one. It’s kinda hard in my state cuz legalization just started so there’s not many flavors available yet. Basically i feel like I’m constantly flavor hunting stiiizy live resin and cdt. I love when I’m in Cali cuz it’s so easy to get whatever flavor i want especially with delivery and Weedmaps. Cheers m8!,2023年6
189,I actually agree! I don't mind the flavored terps but especially the apple fritter so good!,2023年6
190,Live resin is good but to me it all taste like weed lol . but idk if u like the regular distillate pods but try to get orange sunset it’s really good .,2023年6
191,"I love orange sunset! i fux w the distillate pods too, especially pink açaí! Taste like pink starbursts. Me and my girl both love that one.",2023年6

193,"Yeah dude, just went too much too fast. I've been there, you'll be good, just go in moderation and figure out your dose",2023年6
194,Lol you’ll learn to adapt and beat the pain😤I can sometimes take a 5 second hit and it’ll want to crawl right back up my throat but I choose to fight the urge to cough. That experience happens to the best of us. Once I took a shower after a gnarly edible and my first time trying a 35MG in a single bite that I had a panic attack in the shower with all the steam… felt like I couldn’t breathe. Crawled my soapy ass out of there though.,2023年6
195,"Pods are definitely more convenient for me as daily routine before bed & easier to dose as needed to fall asleep. 

These indicas are definitely KO medicine: Skywalker OG, OG Kush, Hardcore OG",2023年6
196,Watermelon Z helps me sleep,2023年6
197,Just picked up to try also; blue dream is a nice energetic body boost. I’d imagine your watermelon z has more peaceful effects,2023年6
198,"Lmk how it is . I’m kinda iffy on trying them out . I never had d8 , HHC or x-blend so idk how they taste or if they’ll get me high",2023年6
199,"Yeah, picked up watermelon z because I'm more a fan of indicas myself",2023年6
200,"Just tried and it's pretty good, 4 hits get a nice high and it tastes like watermelon sour patch",2023年6
201,Oh nice at least you for high from it . How are the hits are they rough ? Also what is even a x-blend mean. And where could I purchase some of these pods . Like in ny city,2023年6
202,"The hits were decent, a little scratchyness and maybe coughing after a couple hits. X blend is their blend of D8 HHC D10 THC-P. Id probably check places that sell D8 or other alt noids or just but then on the website.",2023年6

209,orange sunset is sativa  but we all known sativa/indica isn’t really a true thing i guess u can say . but anyways i love orange sunset that’s my favorite one it taste good and gets you like a high-uplifted feel but also couch locked IMO .,2023年6
210,will it make me giggly?,2023年6
211,Yeah it’s my fav stiz distillate pod,2023年6
212,👍,2023年6
213,"that looks like an old empty pod that u didn’t throw out so the oil kinda spread but is still nowhere near enough to get a hit. i say if u CAN sure. 

if ur concerned about missing logo on mouthpiece it should be other side (though i personally have sone completely scratched off for certain situations i want it to look sleep so i understand)",2023年6
214,ain’t gonna do much but it won’t kill you,2023年6
215,Don’t bro lol,2023年6
216,i’ve gotten three hits out of it i think it’s just clogged with oil,2023年6
217,Looks pretty empty,2023年6
218,Looks like an old empty pod. Lucky you if you can get at least one hit.,2023年6
219,Hopefully you got rid of that thing by now.,2023年6
220,Don’t do it Bruh just order another one,2023年6
221,i just got a battery though,2023年6
222,"I’d say the $60 is worth it. I pay $45 for a full gram pod here in a illegal state (GA) and paid $35 for a battery. I recommend getting the big stiiizy battery since it’s double the voltage of a regular stiiizy battery. The big battery helps out a lot with clogging and getting the oil heated up enough. A full gram pod usually lasts me 1-2 weeks give or take. That’s with using it multiple times a day, everyday. Plus my tolerance is very very high.",2023年6
223,all completely relatively ur tolly and hm u smoke. Big battery is good idea like above suggested. Personally I get the gram pods for less than that or about that price so i DONT think the small half g ones are worth that price. plus the half g ones usually come with a battery right? unless im confusing them with another. they released a few types of pods now. u can get the battery via their site. You can also easily price check local dispo’s to compare the pods price as area matters,2023年6
224,"double the mah, not voltage. voltage on small battery is 3.1-3.3V while biiig is 3.3-3.5V. the battery life is 210mah small and 550mah biiig batt. id recommend the small one because it already heats it up super hot and does the job if you keep it chargedbut i find charging it often is neccessary if you use it heavy and want to get high off 1-2 hits still better than the biiig one",2023年6
225,"half g pods don’t usually come with a battery, you are confusing them w the LiL stiiizys which are the disposable half gram pods w battery attached.",2023年6
226,definitely was. i couldn’t remember the name for them i coulda swore it was disposable tho but i never got it myself so i kinda didn’t wanna speak for it too much. i always stuck w the standard ones,2023年6
227,lol it's easier to tell if bud is real. You know what bud is like right? Carts are the problem when it comes to fakes.,2023年6
228,yes 8ths go as low as 15$ for the stiiizy around my area . 20-30$ for 7 grams .,2023年6
229,"Yeah bro kg is legit, you in SoCal? I’ve been buying from them on and off for at least four or five years.",2023年6
230,"Impossible to tell via picture. Everything can be faked from the barcode to the valid scan. 

You can also get bad synthetic weed. It's not exclusive or carts. 

Also, watch out for pesticides, mold, crushed glass ( makes of look frosty. ) and perfumes to enhance smell.

Other than checking with stiiizy or calling the dispensary and asking them to see a coa, there is virtually no way to tell if yours or anyone eles product is legit.",2023年6
231,Yeah its real i bought some at a dispensary the other day. They have white label grey label and black label.,2023年6
232,Yes,2023年6
233,The bag looks right for the most part and that is a legit current stiiizy flower strain but a packaged on date of 4/20 makes it seems like it’s just mylar for whoever’s weed - but unlike cartridges the risk isn’t so much your health as it is that you might get shitty weed.,2023年6

235,Cali?,2023年6
236,"scans typically have numbers on them now like “verified 1 time(s) before” etc when you scan it so you KNOW your the first to get and scan that specific item ID from them. they can still fake it using fake sites that look identical if your not careful, those will ofcourse always say “first verification” or whatever, but A LOT of major cart companies have started doing this to prevent the knock offs",2023年6
237,yeah the  IE,2023年6
238,they restocked?,2023年6
239,"Wait, they dropped more?",2023年6
240,How,2023年6
241,It feels like it might be a bad pod try to return if u can and show them what it does . i’ve never had that problem at least the other 2 work tho,2023年6
242,this is happening to me,2023年6
243,"Lighter to bottom of cart for 2-3 sec. Insert to cart and hit. You welcome

Further update. This is only a temporary fix

After some research, three blinking lights is a connection issue between gate and cart. We appear to just have gotten damaged carts

I was able to resolve the issue permanently by removing the black metal casing on bottom of cart, you’ll need a pliers or something. It will expose the pins and a jelly like substance holding them in place. Press into pins around jelly to expose pins a little. 

Now cart should work, you may need to press cart into vape a little when hitting. 

I couldn’t get a refund, didn’t want to waste $70 throwing the cart. Hope this helps.

367,"I’m sorry, I’m very new to stiizys so unaware of what to do with a clog. I had done some research though didn’t find anything to my searching ability so I thought I’d find some different answers than the vague “hit it really hard” type advice that friends have given to me!",2023年5
368,man you have no idea what you’re talking about. don’t listen to this guy. if it’s clogged just dry hit your pod (pulling/inhaling from it while it’s not on your battery) will unclog it. sometimes you have to suck hard and for longer than you’d think. don’t fucking blow in it what kind of advice is that. i feel like most of the people who say stiiizy isn’t good are just not the brightest in the head,2023年5
369,Heating it up a bit before you do this helps as well,2023年5
370,"No bud, it's you that has no idea what you are talking about. With 4 big and 4 small batteries, over the last 2 years, I've dealt with every problem there is.

If you stop and think about it. Hitting lightly to activate the heater will melt the clog and help clear it. ""Dry hitting"" it without the battery just means you have to hit it that much harder to clear it. You heat it up and blow through it because hitting it sucks wax into places it doesn't belong and THAT'S how it gets clogged. Blowing through it pushes that wax back where it came from. It will also prevent you from getting a blob of hot wax in your mouth when the clog clears when hitting it in the battery. But you aren't smart enough to figure these things out. 

You are right though. Anyone that says STIIIZY isn't good, like you about clogs, just isn't the brightest in the head.

Oh, and when you graduate form 2nd grade, you might actually learn what capital letters are for. You missed a period too. Looks likes you haven't even learned how to use spell check. lol",2023年5
371,"my stiiizy is not spewing wax out the top, maybe try to actually take care of it and not let it overheat etc. my clogging just refers to airflow being blocked. there’s no wax needing to be pushed out of the way or anything for me so you needa chill😭everyone has different experiences with things",2023年5
372,"In my experience, blowing back after getting some from the top will make it shoot out the sides on the mouthpiece, I’ve never made a issue about it with my local dispensary, but one time I purchased they said if I have issues with clogging or having it spit out a ton I could go back swap for new, they are so cool :)",2023年5
373,"My STIIZY doesn't spit wax out the top either, unless I hit it too hard with it in the battery and the clog clears. But it does for some people. I gave advice on how to avoid that IF it happens to you. 

Do you even know HOW it gets clogged? If you say there's no wax needing to be pushed out of the way then that answer is no. It's the wax that clogs it up. DUH

You need to chill and listen to those of us that know what we are talking about. Just as you said. Everyone has different experiences with things. There's only so much to experience with STIIZY and it's not very much. Just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it hasn't happened to anyone else. But you don't have that much experience yet.

You might want to try someone's tip BEFORE you tell them they don't know what they are talking about. Once again, if you think there's no wax that needs to be cleared, then I have to question if you even HAVE one of these. Let alone have any idea what you are talking about.",2023年5
374,"I haven't had it spit out the sides after getting some wax out the mouthpiece. It's only spit out the top 2 times before I figured out how to warm it up and blow through it before it spits out the top. It really does work. That's why my dab pens have a preheat mode. If it gets plugged, just push the button twice for a 15 second warmup. After warming it up, it hits fine.",2023年5

386,"since when did getting geeked become so hard , I’m used to this and know what to do In order to “fix” ts but it’s just annoying mid wake n bake / shesh lool",2023年5
387,"hey now, I’m not complaining that it lasts me 3days rather than half day 🤷",2023年5
388,Yeah mines usually every two to three days if u wanna fix that problem tho u can get the biiig stiiizy battery,2023年5
389,"Sadly I wish there was a better answer lol, but you’re right, it’s gotten more difficult over the years, but the saddest part is I don’t know if it’s my tolerance or the quality that plays such a huge role anymore",2023年5
390,no you’re good. this has been a well documented issue with lots of posts on this sub of ppl buying from licensed dispos and having that same issue,2023年5

395,"It looks like a little bit left still, Let it sit upright for a few hours and the wax will saturate the coil",2023年5
396,Idk but that looks like a chode man,2023年5
397,There's a good half a cart there bro just leave it upright for a bit looks like there is a lot chillin up top,2023年5

403,bdt,2023年5
404,Is that just for their disposables and are the pods CDT?,2023年5
405,they have multiple lines of pods. the original line is bdt w distillate. the silver line is the cdt line with distillate,2023年5
406,"Strong but the high is wack and they taste either like chemicals or carrots.

Yes, I live in a legal state. 

Yes, I've had both black market and regulated.

Gross.",2023年5
407,I disagree with the guy above. Their DNA line is definitely my favorite. They have a live resin line. But honestly it's very potent and a good high. People's tolerance be through the roof haha. Just pricey depending where you get em,2023年5
408,for reals?,2023年5
409,Yup. Total shit.,2023年5
410,wild for opening the box like that,2023年5
411,I know it’s real. But are they major the boxes smaller now or just angle ?,2023年5
412,same size as always,2023年5
413,"I’ve opened up a few stiiizy pods now and I’m pretty sure you’ll be more than fine. 

I believe that’s just one of the coils (there’s two on each side) that connects to the two little magnetic dots on the bottom. I don’t believe anything bad is gonna happen at all. If anything, I don’t believe that the pod will even work since it’s no longer touching those pins it looks like. But if it does…make sure it doesn’t taste burnt or anything 🤣

Bad batch nothing more imo. Stick with 510 threads 👍",2023年5
414,Please take that back to where you bought it.,2023年5
415,Plastic isn’t indestructible bud.,2023年5
416,what the heck 😂 i would take it back if u can to refund,2023年5
417,Take a pair of pliers and a piece of wax paper and pop the mouth off the cart and flip onto wax paper to catch oil. Then you’ve got some goodies to smear.,2023年5
418,"Thank you, I got a replacement pod from the company I had gotten it from, this is the first stiizy ive had any problem with it still works but doesnt hit like it should free dabs are cool though",2023年5
419,I just got a replacement pod today (got to keep this one) still works but doesnt hit that great lol,2023年5
420,maybe u should try and get the wax out somehow and dab it,2023年5
421,That would indeed be a battery.,2023年5
422,"It's legit. None of the batteries are the same as what you see on the box. I have 4 BIIIG battery's and 4 matching small ones. I have the blue battery that you have on the box, but the picture on my box was purple. My 2nd battery was the small blue one. I almost didn't buy the blue one because the picture showed a light, powder blue. Too girly for me but I needed blue, so I bought it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a darker, kind of a Ford blue.

I can see where the sticker was that says what color it is. What did it say on that and what color was it? I didn't know that the box with the purple picture was actually the blue I wanted until I noticed that the sticker itself was blue and read it. I was looking at that box for weeks before I took a closer look and saw the sticker.",2023年5
423,But I’m checking if it’s legit they make fake ones that don’t come from stiiizy,2023年5
424,that’s pretty cool actually where u get it from,2023年5
425,I remember I got my charging chase for $1 🔥 & and I barley even use it lol,2023年5
426,the stiiizy website! it was like $35 and it holds a lil pod and charges ur batt while it's in there,2023年5
427,can y’all scan the codes all the posts are this atp,2023年5
428,Scan the QR code an it’ll tell you,2023年5
429,They look legit in my eyes u should’ve took picture of the pods and bottom of it,2023年5
430,Aye man that X Blend is different,2023年5
431,"let me know how u like it, im in an illegal state considering picking up some",2023年5
432,yooo what is this website,2023年5
433,I get the replacement pods for 14.99 in Dallas,2023年5
434,No way that site is legit,2023年6
435,"Do it bro they are blowing everyone out the water with these prices. I’ve heard  it’s fire and I picked up 5 pods, a battery and a pack of edibles for less than $85",2023年5
436,what shop u buy em at dallas?,2023年6
437,Well the prices aren't crazy compared to other delta 8 and hhc offerings it's pretty standard pricing,2023年5
438,That’s real. It’s tested by LK Labs in Sparta IL I strongly doubt if it was fake they would know to put that lab on the label. For the code I think each state is different since they are manufacturing the pods in each state locally,2023年5
439,"Real, I purchase from Ascend Fairview and got this same one. Made by a company Aeriz in IL. Different packaging for IL",2023年5
440,"~~Fake. Real pods don’t have a QR link to user manual, though you can look it up on their website. Sorry blud~~

[The QR code isn’t even to their real website manual/FAQ](https://www.stiiizy.com/pages/faq); the [Shopify](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2426/0015/files/STZY_Universal-Manual_1080_v3.pdf) >>> Stiiizy link should’ve tipped you off immediately",2023年5
441,Its real 10000%,2023年5
442,Update: my dispensary has given me a full credit to get another one,2023年5
443,Appreciate the response. In the picture that is a dispo sticker. The manufacturer date is 2023,2023年5
444,"Idk man, I’m from Cali and I’ve gotten plenty of CDT pods before and the color is different from this one. This looks more like a regular pod. The CDT’s over here have a darker looking oil.",2023年5
445,It’s a real stiiizy. But they are made with ariez oil is what I heard,2023年5
446,different states have different packaging laws/requirements. this is a real IL stiiizy,2023年5
447,You sure? Im new to dispos but they actually be selling fake shit?,2023年5
448,no it’s not dude,2023年5
449,"Just saw the labs review, IL QR codes might still have some lingering issues since they only just pulled up there & they manufacture locally. As long as the dispensary you got it from is licensed [search cannabis licence lookup] you’re Gucci

I wonder if they selectively have the QR code in some states bc I never saw it in any of the Western states I went to. But every other person round here’s a pothead so didn’t need the step-by-step",2023年5
450,"Bless your heart, Stiiizy has brand recognition & is one of the most commonly faked company names as such. 

But even grey market ones will scan to validate. Is that back tab in pic 5 a dispensary sticker or part of the packaging? Is the manufacturing date recent or ‘21-22? Also, what state are you in?",2023年5
451,Never trust stiiizy products at dispensary’s if they are not a stiiizy dispensary . Unless u know forsure they are actually legit . but yeah it’s fake,2023年5
452,It literally is …,2023年5
453,Box looks legit but it does look pretty light 🤔🤔. u got it from stiiizy dispensary or somewhere else ?,2023年5
454,U said it’s invalid code and it’s light colored asf brother it’s fake,2023年5
455,Scan it. Stiiizy CRCs their live resins to holy hell.,2023年5
456,I’ve gotten that one too mine looked exactly like it,2023年5
457,different strains look different from eachother once theyre extracted. you can find dark or light Live resin stiiizys in circulation on any given day.,2023年5
458,it said that my serial code was invalid😮 https://imgur.com/a/pgSo2w0,2023年5
459,but i just saved it and it said my serial code is invalid. its not safe if it says that right? https://imgur.com/a/pgSo2w0,2023年5
460,"This is true yes, but Stiiizy does still CRC their stuff. No way in all hell is all of their LR, LR Diamonds and pods are that light all day, every day. They do color remediation to achieve that color.",2023年5
461,Make sure you entered in correctly. But if it is coming back as invalid it is definitely fake. Where'd you get it?,2023年5
462,that’s correct it’s fake,2023年5
463,could you cite your source?,2023年5
464,"this isn’t fake. stiiizy had an issue where a bunch of their verification codes got zapped. there were half a dozen posts a week abt it at one point. this pod has the new smooth hardware, it’s real",2023年5
465,"If I could find a source sure! But I worked for stiiizy for a while and can confirm they CRC. They use several different strains to achieve a single live resin. Let alone, every single concentrate I had from them tasted the exact same. Let me see if I can’t find an actual source instead of my word.

Couldn’t find the source but I called two stores and they both said they use solvents in the process for extraction BUT I’m gonna try and do more research and see what exactly they do. I’ll see if I can’t get a hold of Ironworks and directly ask them.",2023年5
466,Kinda is surprising .. Even Seattle washington doesn’t have Stiiizy they do have Cookies brand tho,2023年5
467,But to answer ur question i have no clue about it,2023年5
468,"Fake products won’t pop the ‘this is authentic! enjoy!’ message, it’ll say the time and date it was first scanned and how many times it’s been scanned since. 

You’re good to go brother, enjoy!!!",2023年5

470,Hahaha then f it real or fake it's workin lol but It does look legit though,2023年5
471,"Yuh looks official to me, cheers mate🔥",2023年5
472,"It's legit. But next time you purchase, try to get a fresher batch.",2023年5
473,Tbh i dont think its real just based off the sticker in the back and whats the url did u scan it on the stiiizy website not the fake site,2023年5
474,bet thanks,2023年5
475,"bro are u slow? i’m going obviously asking for a reason, no stiiizy stores in nyc",2023年5

480,that battery is fake,2023年5
481,How’s the white raspberry i’m about to crack that one open saving the strawnana for last so I’m hype you said it’s good 🤣,2023年5
482,live resin pods smack but i like cdt bc it gets me much more high bc the live resin terpenes + distillate is much more potent (obv) so it’s just ideal for people with higher tolerances / smoke everyday,2023年5
483,What makes you say that,2023年5
484,It’s great plan on picking up more soon,2023年5
485,i have gotten fake ones too from “plugs” years ago before i was 18 and they always had the weed logo in that exact spot. real stiiizy batteries have never had that Ca logo there or any kind of cannabis warning on them because there isn’t an thc in the battery just pods. also the magnet is much stronger than normal stiiizy and the bottom part at the charging port comes off easily. might use your pods faster but can’t do much harm.,2023年5
486,Appreciate that bro went out an got new big battery had an old one but don’t have the box so don’t know if that was legit but I got a new big one an it didn’t have the CA on it,2023年5
487,nice! yeah i’ve never seen a fake biiig stiiizy.,2023年5

494,"What has worked for me is taking very small hits at first. Like barely getting any vapor hits. Once you build up a tolerance increase the size of the hits. Ride the high and tell yourself it’s only temporary and will wear off in a couple of hours if you get anxious. I’ve slowly built up to taking bigger hits and not getting panicky if I get too high. Only get high in comfortable settings either by yourself or with someone you really trust until you know you can handle it. 

Also, stick to indicas or indica dominant hybrids at first. I’m enjoying Apple Fritter right now.",2023年5
495,"It’s all preference tbh. Do u like a mellow high or a euphoric? From my experience , the indicas and some hybrids are good for relaxation.",2023年5
496,"Try out either the live resin or soul ventless pods 
Stick to Hybrids and Indicas they tend to be the most relaxing",2023年5
497,gelato is a MAJOR sleeper i love it,2023年5
498,I just smoked my new apple fritter cart and I did get some anxiety but I am at a new place so it makes some sense of why haha; this cart tastes so good it's insane. A strong upbringing and I don't feel any body aches whatsoever. I wanted to make sure it was authentic since I did some research before buying and I am glad there is a scratch off QR code to verify. I love that feature so you are not worried!,2023年5
499,I like euphoric for sure,2023年5
500,[deleted],2023年5
501,really? how come? i also have a lot of anxiety and smoking carts especially gives me panic attacks,2023年5
502,this is true but there’s times where i feel uplifted and not as tired as i would be by smoking indica .,2023年5

507,"You have probably got one or the other by now. But I would get and have both.

 The big battery heats up faster, so it hits harder, and the charge lasts much longer. The small battery is more discrete when you're out and about and the live resin pods like the small battery better. When the big battery needs a charge and you want a hit, you can use the small battery.",2023年5
508,as a real heavy smoker the full gram stiiizy pods last me about like maybe 4 days,2023年5
509,I love stiiizy full grams because they fill that bitch almost to the top unlike those wack ass plug and plays where they only last you like 2 days 🤣🗑️,2023年5
510,[deleted],2023年5
511,Apparently there discounts codes for items in the Stiiizy shop.,2023年5
512,"Yes, I used Stiizy gummies and pods when I went to Cali and I just tried the Stiizy X blend gummies a few hours ago. I ordered a bottle of the Stiizy X blend gummies, delta 8 gummies, and the delta 9/CBD gummies. I have only tried the x blend so far which is basically a mix of delta 8 & 9 and took slightly less than my usual amount with various other brands and got better effects. 

I haven't tried the pods yet but have heard those are really fire even for people who don't love HHC. I feel like overall all Stiizy products are great in my experience, hemp line or normal legal line. Plus I only paid $59 for 3,000 mg of gummies shipped. I ordered them on Wednesday and got them by Saturday.",2023年5
513,I’m about to try the x blend I can’t believe I spent 60$ on 3 grams my plug sells 1 grams of questionable carts for 60 hope the legal shits fire,2023年6
514,"So if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying better than regular Stiiizy?",2023年5
515,"Please let us know the results. Personally, I don't trust anything but delta 9 which is why I only got the edibles.",2023年6
516,"On the same level, I didn't notice any difference between these gummies and the ones I had in Cali. Got me just as fried and I have a very high tolerance unfortunately.",2023年5
517,Definitely got stoned of that shit I hear u with the only smoking d9 but if u live in a illegal state like me and don’t have Pablo Escobars son as your plug definitely would recommend and I feel like if u go with a actual company like stiiizy u should be fine don’t smoke gas station d8 is what I’m trying to say 😭,2023年6
518,"Wow - that really is impressive. I think I'll put in an order for the D9 gummies when I get paid on Friday in this case! I do a mix of D9 gummies purchased from local smoke shops as well as gummies from dispensaries if I travel to legal states. This should be interesting. I also really like 1:1 THC:CBD blends as it is a mellower high. I'm not doing the carts because I don't trust the derivatives, aka I only buy carts from dispensaries in legal states whether I get it directly or indirectly. Call me old school, but for me it's D9 or bust whether it's from weed or hemp.",2023年5
519,I drive to legal states or get stuff shipped to me from people that run to dispensaries in legal states.,2023年6
520,It’s legit,2023年5
521,Sometimes plugs or vendors scan prior to make sure it’s legit. If the site is verify.stiiizy.com and u the second or third I say ur still good in the clear. Was the rest of the box tampered with?,2023年5
522,If it was already scanned not by you then it’s fake,2023年5
523,"Hard to tell tbh, I go to the actual Stiiizy store & just scanned one of mine out of curiosity. Just picked up a live resin pod yesterday & it says serial code is invalid on the website so it’s a hit or miss by stiiizy if they activate it or if they re-use codes or it’s a valid new code",2023年5
524,It’s illegal but in my experience TSA doesn’t care. They aren’t really worried about or looking for thc vapes.,2023年5

531,"honestly i hate stiizy flower. i’m not a big fan of the brand at all whatsoever. the flower is dry, smokes harsh, tastes like ass, leaves grey ash, etc. 

with that being said tho, thc percentages are not the only thing to look at while you’re looking for weed. you’re gonna find shake out there that reads  30% thc, but are you gonna buy it ? no you’re not.  i’ve smoked indoor that read 25-28% thc and been way higher off that shorty 30% weed. and yk why ? bc the quality and grade is different.",2023年5

538,also it hurts my brain to read your broken english..,2023年5
539,provide the rest of the dms… just get a rig or take a t break. stizzy is casual if you want to be faded get a rig,2023年5
540,They were helping at the end as you can see lol but after they blocked for what reason after they said to contact through the form which I did no reply either…,2023年5
541,it’s a glitch in the system if it’s already verified in the future,2023年5
542,*and* scanned 3 times? should i try a rescan?,2023年5
543,"He's right that the already verified in the future happens with legit Stiiizy products. On the scanned 3 times part, if it was fake it would say hundreds of times. I think the scanned 3 times part might be the people selling it scanned it, you know what I mean?",2023年5
544,Thank you for your help everybody but this was a hemp pod I bought from a vape shop ignorantly. Looked it up and got charged double what they’re worth and the tests is just more evidence that I was scammed. Oh well! I can always buy another one.,2023年5
545,Try putting it in a wallet or stick it in your shoe. Separate the pod and battery maybe toss it with some girls bag that has make and shit etc Goodluck I think you’ll be fine just play it smart and don’t get caught once in,2023年5
546,Metal detectors don’t really go off but maybe put the pod in your shoe and even in your sock if you don’t want to risk it and the battery toss in a bag nothing crazy,2023年5

550,What do you mean by that,2023年5
551,Bro I complained to them on twitter they blocked me lol…. What kind of company is that,2023年5
552,If they did that to me I can just imagine how many people they block lol weird company,2023年5
553,Okay but how was the product,2023年5
554,For me they all shit but everyone’s body is different never buying from this company tho after what they did they a whole L 💀,2023年5

556,yeah this guy is clearly like 17 lol jeez i saw his post too 😂,2023年5
557,i was told to use the small. they seem to hit much harder (at least for me) than regular pods. stiiizy also reccomends taking one 2-3 sec hit then waiting 5-10 minutes before the next,2023年5
558,Cool was told the same thing also by a few folks… I have a old school battery…,2023年5
559,They say the Biig burns too hot and will burn them. But that is what I was told. I use the original battery with mine.,2023年5
560,"Small batt only. Small hits only aswell, ive literally burnt them on accident by taking a big rip on a small battery. All in all these are an alright product to begin with",2023年5

What even is the point? You have to preheat most oils again within a minute or two of not hitting that sounds like bullshit

Not to attack you obviously since stiiizy said it",2023年5
562,yeah i’m not sure what they’re thinking with that. i hit it the same i would any other pod and it works just fine,2023年5
563," Small hits and breaks in between is to not burn the pod. The people that want to constantly hit the pen to get high need to invest in a dab rig setup. Vapes are to used for a quick hit. They aren't meant to sesh on and get baked. If that's the case take some dabs of a nail.
Lmao to all the people who share the vapes w/ multiple heads hitting it.  They tend to clog due to heavy drawing. Tastes bad cause of all the blinkers.",2023年6
564,same here anyone got anything,2023年6
565,I called my dispensary and found out. If youre still able to  draw from it just fine and its able to charge you can just keep using it until it die dies,2023年6
566,"these look like they’ve been laying down, stand them up and let the oil fall back, im sure there’s at least a couple strong hits left",2023年5

571,"Nothing but Chinese grade plastic and metal at that point.

Man... how unsafe are these things lol.",2023年5
572,Nice find! Definitely looks like they made packaging and had to redo formulation after the ban. Totally not abnormal for companies to reuse old packaging and cover old graphics. Once I peeled off a sticker on an IPA can and it had a discontinued flavor underneath it haha,2023年5

582,"generally when someone says to cut one open it’s cuz the product inside is mids. Lots of people have complained in the past about prerolls are being stuffed with shitty weed… i haven’t tried stiiizy prerolls but i haven’t heard anything good about them.

628,It’s gonna be half way to live resin. “CDT” is Cannabis-Derived Terpenes. They extract the terps from the plant itself instead of adding other additives. So you’re gonna taste more of a flowery hit (stronger in my opinion) one good hit and you’re big chillin’👌🏽,2023年5

641,Bought it almost 2 weeks ago. I've had 3 and a half since then and I feel like I'm having adverse effects. I should clarify; I've covered up the QR code for now because I've scanned it multiple times to no avail. The QR code just keeps loading when I put it in the verification website. I've contacted Stiiizy directly asking if there's an issue with the verification site.,2023年5
642,questions. You bought it at a smoke shop and not a dispensary.? Red flag one. The box looks faded and the color is off a little. Red flag 2. It’s a sativa edible. And if the guy you bought it from says it’s an Indica or hybrid he’s lying. Major red flag 3. And smoke shops are legally allowed to sell cannabis unless they have the permit which I doubt they have red flag 4. Do people not have common sense anymore???,2023年5
643,You gotta eat them all to find out it’s only 100mg,2023年5

I wrote down yesterday how I felt:

I began to notice that I was finding myself disassociating and generally exhibiting some behavior that I don't think I'd have while sober. My motor skills are also slightly off and I've had an inability to focus as well as I used to. Time perception also feels strange, it doesn't feel like a whole day has just passed. I'm able to remember things, but it just feels strange. Not sure if brain fog is the right word to describe it but it feels like I'm slightly intellectually impaired. I'm genuinely unsure whether this is placebo and I'm just hyper aware of everything or if there's actual brain damage. I've yet to go to the gym and exercise since I've read that can just get you higher; I'll do that today.

since writing this, I went to the gym last night and felt much better; it seemed like the effects were gone and that I was functioning normally. It's Saturday morning now and I feel like the effects are coming back a little bit. It's really difficult to tell how much of this is placebo.",2023年5
649,"The serial number will not work for stiiizy verification, that’s only for use with their vapes. 

It is also normal for you to feel differently when taking edibles than you do when sober, you may just not be a sativa person (I’m not either)",2023年5

651,I’ve gotten this before with edibles in general like a weed hangover feeling that lasts a few days. I will say it’s been more noticeable to me on delta 8 gummies versus normal delta 9 gummies but they should in edible form process directly into the same thing so could just be me.,2023年5
652,"is there any other way to verify if it's legit or not?

also I have taken edibles before, and my recovery has been fine. It might just be the frequency with which I took these; all within a span of a week.",2023年5
653,"are these edibles delta 8?

it's been slightly over a week since I took the edible. At this point I'm back to normal, but every now and then something kicks in ever so slightly. Tends to happen when I'm in an unfamiliar place or situation.   


overall, really strange experience that had me spooked.",2023年5
654,I don’t know could be. Delta 8 and delta 9 should process into the same thing in the body. You could have just done too much edibles are 100% different from smoking so if you’re not use to edibles it could be like a first time thing. I had what you described to me the first time I smoked good good weed for days I was like hazed out and then again when I took edibles for the first time years later. You said smoke shop and not dispensary. I highly suggest looking into to what you smoke / eat online if you want to go the grey legal route or just get stuff from dispos.,2023年5
655,why have they not dropped a new battery with variable heat instead? why would someone want a gram disposable,2023年5
656,"omfg do we really need more of these? so many batteries getting thrown back into the earth killing our planet it’s so sad. they really need to ban disposable vapes of all kinds imo, they suck ass anyways they never hit as hard or have as good of a draw as a regular pod and battery system",2023年5

662,"They wouldn’t make it unless there’s a market for it, and the truth is a lot of the market is filled with occasional smokers, that would make a 1g dispo last a few months. 

But you’re also right, stiiizy needs a “pro” style battery that has variable temp settings. They have needed one since the solventless line came out and people were burning up the pods with w their big stiiizy.

Design wise, put the three I’s in stiiizy be it’s own temp pre set. When you pull you can tell what temp it’s at by how manny are lighting up. And make it USB-C compatible and I would be one happy dude.",2023年5

Instead of learning search functions on Twitter n all, I learned the platforms I was stuck to (snap for chatting and Facebook for family).

I was just hoping for a bigger connection than “yep! That’s us!” when asked, still just seems up in the air (which is valid with alt noids being kinda up in the air, 2023 farm bill fuckery).

I agree. There’s some behind the scenes posts hinting that it’s HHC-P > HHC-O, which raises questions about these altnoids’ synthesis / whether it’s an organic product vs what’s effectively modern spice. I think only time will tell to see whether this product line gets more promo or dies out with federal legalisation, and they still haven’t responded to me re that. At the same time, a major brand entering the Farm Bill legal space puts more pressure to federally legalise. 

Fingers crossed … I’m hoping for the best.",2023年5
709,"Been keepin an eye on them too, the tech behind it with portable accounts n all that seems like a good future for social media compared to every other “revolutionary idea”. Not sure how you feel about the r/altcannabinoids space but H4CBD has been helping me a bit, slightly psychoactive cbd. Fair warning it’s thick for vapes though.

I see a space for it, but I also see the malice behind hiding how it’s made and all. Basically none of it besides trace amounts are directly derived from hemp, most are converted somehow from another precursor. So while each one genuinely may offer benefits to some users over THC, the reactants, catalysts, and literally anything else used may contaminate the product unless properly tested. Additionally some of the more knowledgeable users in the alt noids subreddit have pointed out differences between K2/spice and these noids, something about those synthetics being less similar to the natural compounds, with thc-jd being the only culprit out there in the wild.

I’m hoping that no matter what, the industry’s little detour into alt noids wasn’t for nothing yk? Each noid and every variation of that noid is entirely unique, almost akin to strains.

HHC-P is ~33× stronger than THC due to its hydrocarbon chain length. Are ya’ll still getting effects from organically-derived THC after use?

712,"Yeah in that case CBD’s already doing it’s job. I’ve peeked at cbdp and some other variants but there’s nothing solid on their effects yet. Brand new market with a lot of the CBD based noids.

HHC-P isn’t 33x stronger as advertised, that’s sadly just hype. When they compare these noids in strength, they’re strictly going off binding affinity to CB1 and CB2. When it comes to -p noids (thcp and others as well), they do tend to wreck tolerance, but in a much shorter term than if you’d wreck your tolerance the same amount from smoking. Most people don’t use them pure though, mostly in single digit percentages to add effects or make another noid “stronger”. It is a whole frontier though, and it’s definitely being abused by manufacturers at the moment.

If you’d like to try any alt noids at all, edibles are completely safe to go with. Keep in mind it’ll convert the cannabinoids to their hydroxy variants (like regular edibles), but still worth the venture. They’re worlds cheaper and definitely more comparable.

757,So you’re asking if you can smuggle drugs into another country? I’d recommend against it unless you really like jail. I don’t think things change at all when you’re talking about drug smuggling.,2023年4
758,no yall are stupid asf asking questions like this on the reddit😭 u get checked when u land there and when u land back in the US. theyre 100% gonna find it and slap u w international charges u dont want. get mota at the resort ur going to lol.,2023年4
759,"TSA is a joke. Doubt they’ll even know it if they see it. If they do they can’t do anything but throw it away in legal states. 

Border customs is not a joke, they will arrest you. Even American citizens have zero constitutional rights at customs. Find a local supply or take the T break and get extra Fed up when you get home.",2023年4
760,"The only valid advice is to never attempt to smuggle drugs through customs. You run the risk of incarceration or deportation and could be charged with a serious crime. With that said, the following is not advice nor do I recommend doing so… buuut US to Mexico is about as low risk as it gets and dogs won’t alert on a single pod or 510 cart inside a ziploc mixed in with your toiletries in a sealed suitcase with the battery stored separately in a carry on. Marijuana is legal in Mexico as of 2021 but legal dispensaries are not widely open. It’s very, very easy to buy weed there, but quality is generally poor or extremely overpriced in tourist areas. Just take edibles mixed in with legit gummy vitamins/mints or whatever, honestly much easier and basically foolproof.",2023年4
761,No.,2023年4
762,"So the only thing I can tell you is that when packing your stuff so not attempt to hide it have it on your personal or carry on if. 

If TSA or Customs sees it and decided to confiscate it that will most likely be the end of it because they know it's for personal use. It's when you have it in a checked bag that the bag gets flagged and you get pulled to the side and you have to answer questions in my personal experience. 

what I usually do is bring disposable pens they don't get a second look because they look like the nicotine disposal pens that everybody has these days. Stiiizys are a tough one because they are in a separate battery and a big cart of disty. Where I'm at Stiiizys are costly and I have the Biiig battery so I don't like risking confiscation so I'll buy the disposables from my local shop.

 All and all this is still against the law depending on local laws where you're traveling too. I just wanted to give you my own personal experiences and an alternative to people not answering in detail and just trying to make you feel like an insane person for asking a question on Reddit. Stay high stay fly.",2023年4
763,ehh u shouldn’t post this…. but u can try ofc. scrape off the stizzy logo and the warning logo on too the pod and walk thru with it in ur pocket and bring nicotine pods as well n a nic vape that looks super similar. that’s my best suggestion if ur gunna do it anyway,2023年4
764,"ive had tsa hold my stiizy up n look at it right along side my nicotine vape and have no clue there was a difference because i scratched all warnings off the pod n stuff BUT border patrol is MUCH DIFFERENT and will actually care if they do find it and not toss it or pretend they didn’t notice (youd be surprised how many times u didnt go undetected, u just got hooked up) they will arrest u on the spot for drug smuggling, ESPECIALLY if ur bringing it back in to the US and you WILL be convicted. We’re not ALL Britney Griner!",2023年4

I smoked in both airports inside the bathrooms lmao. If you’re caught just be honest and say it’s for personal use and the worst thing is it will be confiscated.",2023年5

806,I think the hate might come from fake ones. Personally I prefer the pax pod system when I visited a legal state in terms of effects and taste but it’s hard to beat stiizy price for the quality and loads of choices.

955,"just so you know, you didn’t go to a licensed dispensary but it looks like that may be a legit stiiizy. licensed new jersey dispos aren’t going to have cali marked product",2023年4
956,"Apparently most of the weed in the New York dispensarys is from Cali. If anyone here is from New York NYC is well aware of all the ""illicit"" dispensary there is literally about 8blegal dispensary to about 500plus not licensed . NYC refuses to prosecute anyone for weed so it's allowed",2023年5

962,Then why are verifying it 4 more times?,2023年4
963,"I think you’re good bro, I mean a huge red flag is if it’s been checked before and if you’re the first idk how much more legit you want 😆 i can’t think of any other way to prove it’s real other than the fact it had been unscanned before opening and the oil and cart look right..",2023年4
964,Thank u brother,2023年4

978,Good until I losted it 😡. I am tired of posting about my weed endeavors everyone just wants to say fake fake fake. But future reference I am doing what you did and I am going to buy the stizzy vape so I can get the pods like you have,2023年5
979,Ahhhh which dispo ? I’m in north cal,2023年4
980,"you don’t really gotta hold it in lmao
95% of the thc enters your bloodstream instantly, i just do lung hit wait a second and blow out",2023年4

984,"Never happened to me, just don’t treat ur pens like chapstick and keep upright",2023年4
985,"Leave upright at all time, take some isopropyl alcohol and clean the connections points that are in the battery slot. You can also take a blow dryer and heat up the cart, if you do that then don’t do it a long time, then leave it in a upright position so the oil can all group together without any bubbles or clogs",2023年4
986,"Ok so they changed something with their manufacturing in january. Hoping they fix it…here’s what works. 

- Keep the pods upright ALWAYS.

- If it’s cold, warm it up before you hit it- I stick mine in my pocket or waistband, you can also use a hairdryer. Must make the wax flow easier, I don’t know. 

- don’t hit blinkers. I fucking love blinkers. Don’t do it, these shitty new pods can’t handle it.

- biiig batteries tend to hit hotter than  the normal ones. Just fyi. 

-that pod is fubar. You could drain it and dab it, that’s what I’m gonna do with my 4 pods that have clogged. Annoying but I can’t waste that much. Hope stiiizy fixes it but the biggest thing for me was not hitting blinkers. If you take big hits your battery is probably fine and it’s just the pods.",2023年4

995,"It heats up really quickly but it comes out from the mouth piece and it’s so annoying, I’ve cleaned it several times and everytime I try to take a hit it’s either air or the wax. Should I just get a new battery? It’s really such a shame if that’s the case cause I liked this one. :/",2023年4

1000,"Yeah mine were doing that, wax out the mouth. Annoying for sure! I really think it’s probably The pod not the battery, my pods were malfunctioning the same way with both a normal battery and a big one. I don’t think you’re gonna be able to get that pod to work, you could get a new one and try it with this battery. Again though, small hits!",2023年4

1019,Ngl id be snacking on a bag of these if they werent edibles,2023年5
1020,Is the high to much ? I haven’t smoked in a few months and my tolerance isn’t as it was like before when I would smoke daily so I’m sure I’ll get high pretty quick . I just don’t wanna get to high I get paranoid . How long do the effects last ? I don’t do edibles to much either . The pods I smoked a lot befor,2023年4
1021,No bs💯💯I ended up getting 5 other flavors 🔥,2023年5
1022,Well my tolerance is high rn and but these gummies got me high pretty fast for a bout 3 hours as much as I can remember. Its like smoking a pod for the first time for me atleast. Like super high and feel good. Everyones different though so take that for what you will. In general id say theyre a little more on the strong side for me personally,2023年4
1023,Thats pretty lit. Hows strawberry if youve had it?,2023年5
1024,"If you're talking about the sour strawberry one I haven't tried it yet,only pineapple one and blue raspberry blast🔥🔥I have it tho probably take them later when I go to work😂",2023年5

1026,i’m my opinion CDT is a bit stronger than og,2023年4

1044,Stiiizy was never a 510 cart.,2023年4

1050,Lmao Not at all. At least not when he told me. But legit embarrassed rn ha ha,2023年4
1051,Customers must have been VERY confused haha,2023年4
1052,I found out how to fix it if you are having the same problem. I used a fork or any prying tool to get the black part out of the colored part. Then I cut the yellow tape a bit and then moved the battery by pushing it below the casing. Then i got the charging port and put alot of forced to get it over the two little things sticking up and put the charging port in place. Then I put the battery back and pushed it back into the normal casing. I might have to take it out again later and put the tape on just to make sure nothing bad happens but I think it should work now. Just remember to proceed with caution and don't try it if you just used it because it might be hot. I tried it when I never used it once so I think I was safe.,2023年4
1053,"Could be a counterfeit battery. I just gotta another biiiig one from stiiizy, it was $40 something",2023年4

1137,"They’re only sending them out to certain shops. Basically its one of those things where if they can keep their mouth shut, they’ll send them, but its on the Low Low since Stiiizy is just now announcing themselves to the hemp world. 
Its important for companies to keep a low profile, especially when dealing with hemp derived weed, bc there are so many grey areas w/ the law… which is why I’m hella careful which company I buy from. Stiiizy’s reputation precedes it so I immediately decided to try these.
THCO is derived from Delta 8, but if you know what you’re doing, you can go to the moon faster than if you vaped actual THC. If you see the X-Blend Ingredients, you see there is not THC-O. THCO is not for your average consumer. 
Since THCO high’s are close to the real THC, not the Delta hemp… There is more grey area so most companies stay away from THCO but the reality is that its legal as long as they keep it under law guidelines. I’m so lucky my shop has them all. Gelato is beautiful too, but I mentioned Biscotti bc one of its Parents is Gelato. Both these strains are some of my favorites.
I should mention that I’m toasted as hell off a couple hits lmao.",2023年4

BUT in my time away from Stiiizy i discovered Plug Play and lemme tell you, if you haven’t please try it. my fav pod is their apple slush because it tastes like a jolly rancher but gets you hella fucked up. they’re stronger in potency and better tasting than Stiiizy (but a little pricier) sorry for the rant i’m high rn lmao but i “highly” recommend plug play!",2023年4
1152,this is real. everything checks out including the verification,2023年4
1153,Why does it look All scratch and what’s that white shit on the mouth peice ?,2023年4
1154,It’s scratched that’s an indication that it’s been coming in and out of pockets. It looks reused. So I wouldn’t if I were you.,2023年4
1155,Treat dispensaries like bars! If you're let into a 18+ then you're more likely to buy fake shit and spend more on it.,2023年4
1156,"Real if you just opened it and it wasn’t opened before also if the thing where ur supposed to scratch is already scratched and u didn’t do it watch out but other than that it’s real, I got this pod 2 days ago lmao",2023年4
1157,"Dude took a hit of it already bro you can literally see the bubbles 😂😂 OP, you're good",2023年4
1158,"If you mean the QR code, I did that, I used the verification website",2023年4
1159,"Yea lmao it was the Carmex I put on 😂, the hit kinda irritated my throat so I made the post, I was just thinking it’s the distillate because I’m used to hash rosin and live resin",2023年4
1160,"If it came back legit 
I’m confused on why ask? Lol",2023年4
1161,"yea, it’s cause it’s distillate, the hits feel cleaner but your throat will hurt a bit more, same stuff happens with their completely real altenoid ones told under the trademark “Stiiizy Hemp”",2023年4
1162,"I got it from a shop not a licensed dispo, and the distillate irritates my throat at times, was just asking the subreddit to be safe.",2023年4
1163,"Distillate is a lil harsher than things like live resin or rosin but I would be careful, always buy from licensed dispensaries",2023年4
1164,Places like that I would buy pods from just a precaution. But that’s me,2023年4
1165,"yeah, but if it’s the first time it’s ever been scanned you can trust you’re getting a real product",2023年4
1166,assuming it’s the real verification site ofc,2023年4
1167,It’s not worth the risk when flying internationally. So many different factors and a language barrier makes it difficult.,2023年4
1168,"I love wtrmln!! How was the purple papaya?,",2023年4
1169,They pretty good to be honest,2023年4
1170,You should also try the kush mintz 👌,2023年4
1171,I had the wrtmln live resin full gram pod and half way through it tasted so burnt,2023年4
1172,it has a really nice fruity flavor which surprised me. i know pods can be hit or miss on flavor but the papya is definitely there!,2023年4
1173,going to get that next. there was a berries & cream lr i saw that looked interesting,2023年4
1174,i’ve been getting that a lot lately with regular pods (like purple punch) to the point it burns the shit out of my throat,2023年4
1175,Yeah Im super disappointed in the 1g stizzy software,2023年4
1176,Where'd you but them? I'm looking for somewhere that the Stiiizy hemp pods are in stock but I'm not having too much luck.,2023年4
1177,we have all stizzys in stock nycglass718.com,2023年5
1178,Ya'll know these are over the .3% legal limit for total THC right?,2023年5
1179,One of my friends in the vape industry got samples from vegas at a trade show when stiiizy first launched the new line. Hoping to see them in my local shops soon,2023年4
1180,Just checked the lab results on their website. Why spread false information? lol,2023年5
1181,"Do you know anything about nycglass718, element vape, or myvaporstore? Those are the only websites that have the pods in stock but I don't know if they're scams or legit.",2023年4
1182,Didn't see you had the xblend. However their D8 one certainly is https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0672/4334/4149/files/40PR-HMP-D8-BLUEBURST-A1123.pdf?v=1679091314,2023年5
1183,Element vape is the only one ive ordered from from those sites. Theyre legit,2023年4
1184,Just asked my homie and he said myvaporstore is legit as well,2023年4
1185,Myvaporstore legit too i buy off them few time,2023年4
1186,However their xblend has an RND coa which isn't supposed to be used sale and is for product development,2023年5
1187,preeesh fam,2023年4
1188,Order off their website stiiizyhemp.com i ordered and it only took 3 days to be delivered.,2023年6
1189,"The xblend also contains HHC-P which is similar to thco and doesn't not occur in the plant, which can be confirmed if you call the lab

DEA said cannabinoids that don't occur in the plant are illegal back in Feb",2023年5
1190,Wdym,2023年5
1191,yooo theyre website has stock now! LFG,2023年4
1192,Can anyone fact check this?,2023年5
1193,yessss 🙏,2023年4
1194,Blue dream so far I still want to try apple fritter,2023年4
1195,Im the same way as you. I prefer the natural flavors over the fake fruity ones. White raspberry is my fav indica with the perfect disty taste my pallate enjoys. Birthday cake is a good hybrid,2023年4
1196,Stiiizy OG distillate is ass now….. CDT where it at,2023年4
1197,What are these carts from California doing in Thailand?,2023年4
1198,Nothing with flavoring,2023年4
1199,"Strawberry cough, all the hybrids taste like brick",2023年4
1200,"Strawberry cough, all the hybrids taste like brick",2023年4
1201,Same,2023年4
1202,Blue burst!,2023年4
1203,Stay away from the blue burst or blue gummy bear. It taste mega artificial and fake asf its good but its wayy too overpowered. it felt like i was smoking cologne. Sfv and I white raspberry are good,2023年4
1204,"Idk the apple fritter tastes kind of like hairspray to me. It’s effects are fine. I love sour tangie and after trying this new 420 white cherry gelato, blue dream.",2023年4
1205,Just got Apple fritter and it’s gas definitley fake though,2023年4
1206,"if u have a tolerance id say cdt is the move but the average user can still get great highs from bdt, definitely not as good tho. bdt is great just bc cdt exists doesn’t mean bdt is automatically “ass”",2023年4
1207,right😭,2023年4
1208,Lol y’all must be new to black market weed market. Thailand has legal bud but there black market is crazy.  Y’all gonna have heart attacks when you find out Cali packs are taking over Thailand if you think this is crazy. YouTube got some wild videos on it check em out. They are there Courtney even better. Every Cali brand is out there.,2023年4
1209,uhhh show?,2023年4
1210,Wait so the OG pods aren’t cdt? Makes sense why they taste kinda artificial,2023年4
1211,"I just came back from Thailand 3 weeks ago. The legal weed market there is off the hook. However, concentrates and edibles with more than. 02 % aren't legal there. Taking these carts out of the state of California and into the country of Thailand is illegal at every level. I visited several dispensaries there and never saw anything like this especially on full display.",2023年4
1212,No like fake tasting. Doesn’t taste like gas yo,2023年4
1213,"Right? Every other cart tastes like it’s original terps, the original stiiizy pods taste a lil artificial, I got a purple punch pod the other day and it tastes like they added a botanical berry terp just rlly sweet and unrealistic not gas",2023年4
1214,it says “green apple flavor” on the package so u know if it’s gonna be a weed/herb/gas tasting one or not. if you want stiiizy pods that that aren’t sweet & fruity then don’t get the ones that are flavored. stiiizy has 4 different lines of pods so i’m sure you can find what you’re looking for. cdt is much better than the bdt (og) ones imo but i like the sweet flavors.,2023年4
1215,there’s 4 lines of stiiizy pods and the kind you are talking about has sweet ones and gas/herbal tasting ones. i think you would like cdt tho,2023年4
1216,"I’m blind lmao I’m now reading my box it does say tropical punch flavor, thanks for pointing that out also noticed the ingredients are thc distillate and terpenes, looking forward to buying a live resin or cdt pod after I’m done with this one",2023年4
1217,"Yeah I didn’t really know the difference between the cdt and original since there’s nothing on the original box that says anything about terpenes it just says the strain name , I haven’t had the cdt ones but I think I’d like it cause I enjoy natural cannabis derived terps it’s just better than botanical added ones and gives a better overall high imo",2023年4
1218,i agree with you fs cdt gives me a way longer lasting high and it’s way more improved than the bdt ones,2023年4
1219,can’t tell from just this pic…,2023年4
1220,😂 “is this fake?” *posts vague as fuck picture of just battery*,2023年4
1221,fake throw it in the trash,2023年4
1222,"fake, mail it to me and I’ll properly dispose of it, all jokes aside, you can’t tell from the pen alone, you need the box and qr code, if u scan it and it’s the first time it’s ever been scanned it’s legit",2023年4
1223,make sure it’s being scanned on the real stiiizy verification site,2023年4
1224,"In the least incriminating way possible, do you have this much stock for personal use or do you sell? I always see people post pictures of a lot of products and I wonder if they bought in bulk to resell or just really like to spoil themselves. I wish my dispo hauls looked like this mannn",2023年4
1225,I am jealous...,2023年4
1226,I love plug plays just got my self a new pod the other day cant go wrong w em imo,2023年4

1246,"I got the white one too, it ain’t boring that color definitely stands out mane",2023年4
1247,"Yeah, cause I’m colorblind I personally use neon colors to spot things, also just cause I have a lot of shiny metal things in my room from being a guitarist",2023年4
1248,Mmmn interesting that did used regular vinyl,2023年4
1249,What gave it away,2023年4
1250,Nice ..,2023年4
1251,Big John Cena fan actually,2023年4
1252,Yeah I got them from a place called Top Shelf skins but it looks like their site is gone now. It was a couple years ago now. Maybe try Amazon or eBay if you are interested.,2023年4
1253,"Never seen ‘em,heard wonderful things about ‘em.",2023年4
1254,Kinda hard to tell based off the pics but I have the same blue color and they look the same ( I bought mine from an actual stizzzy location),2023年4
1255,Depends on where you got them! I have the same blue stiiizy and I got it at a 21+ Dispo.,2023年4
1256,big battery is far superior.,2023年4
1257,[deleted],2023年4
1258,Biiig camo is the way,2023年4
1259,"I’ve heard the opposite, that fake ones have the weed logo, and it’s not even required since the product doesn’t contain weed",2023年4
1260,You got me there I had forgotten that,2023年4
1261,Imo Purple punch/gdp gotta be one of the hardest hitters,2023年4
1262,Would definitely need to be in a hot box situation for 2nd hand to really do anything. A little vape gas i doubt it would get you lifted even a smidgen.. it's all in your head..,2023年4
1263,It’s all in ur head ur prolly one of them panicky annoying ass hell types if that’s how smoke makes ya feel don’t kick it wit em cuz they gone eventually wanna smoke 😂,2023年4
1264,you can’t get high off the lil stiiizy pens secondhand like that but u have shit friends if they knew ab that already lol,2023年4
1265,"You’re making your mind force itself to believe it, I can’t say to easily calm down but next time if by chance it happens again just stay calm, you’re fine",2023年4
1266,Lol i was thinking this lil vapes of second hand stizzy cant get me high i wish lol,2023年4
1267,I want to try these so bad 😭😭,2023年4
1268,How would you say it made you feel? Like high at all? I’ve been questioning these as I want to start my delta 9 thc tbreak,2023年4
1269,I want to try these so bad 😭😭,2023年4
1270,Wtf??? Real stiiizy makes HHC pods???,2023年4
1271,I literally called Stiiizy dispensaries to confirm. It’s SO new it’s basically unknown. They just launched the website and such,2023年4
1272,"SICK now stiiizy found a loophole to expand nationwide.   I was living in Utah for a bit back in 2022 , delta 8 is illehal there but HHC isn’t.",2023年4
1273,The only thing I find strange is why isn’t still promoting these like the regular thc stuff and other pods .,2023年4
1274,Im about to delete this app. This shit is so fake,2023年4
1275,how did you find these? is the website back in stock?,2023年4
1276,Comparing it to a regular stiiizy the rod in the middle looks thicker and the Stiiizy font seems more bold on the HHC pod. I didn’t see these in the products on the website any links?,2023年4
1277,these are fucking gas. been flooding tx lately,2023年5
1278,I feel like if I'm been hitting quality oil  I am definitely stoned and that's cause i know for a fact my tolerance is shit..  i smoke Alot Thcp and d90 .. and these pods smack ..,2023年4
1279,"I just picked up one today, I’m a very heavy bud smoker and this hhc pod just impressed the hell outta me! Definitely worth the money",2023年5
1280,"It's good, and they are transparent with their labs. That being said.... Read everything for their labs. Certain flavors have certain things in them. But most are clean.
At least they're transparent and aren't lying. One just a small but of pesticide but harmless, and some other chemical. You can check for example d8 Skywalker og",2023年4

1283,That is 100% correct and they are fire 🔥🔥,2023年4
1284,"They're not associated. These Texas shops have them, but I believe they are manufactured by some other company. Same that makes packwood d8, hhc runtz d8, hhc, cookies hhc and some other I don't remember.

They're able to turn the  brands into legal ones, but completely be unassociated.

They're cheap as hell for a reason",2023年4
1285,"Yes, and they are one of the best HHC brands on the market right now",2023年5
1286,Speed to market!!!!! Let's go!!!! I can confirm it's fire can't wait to try the x Blend pod,2023年4

I’ve tried slowly and quickly drawing while clogged and slow draws can fix it but it’s a headache either way. So my two cents, keep it upright after use. I’ve also tried blowing it back into the cart, which just cause the distillate to leak out of the side “vents”.",2023年4
1335,It's always best to keep the rubber on the front life works better that way. LOL,2023年4

1345,overtime you’d save more buying pods but the lil ones have 1:1 ratio strains and are better to hit imo,2023年4
1346,"I used to go through a 1g pod every few days for years. Bought hundreds of pods, so I'm gonna give you an honest opinion here. They make a great pod. Its a little on the deluxe side, and you pay for it, but you also get huge hits and great taste. 
My biggest gripe is their batteries. They haven't updated the design since they came out over 5 years ago. I want temp control and USB C. Stopped using them since I dropped my baggery into the aea while fishing, but I will be honest I do miss the fatter hits you can rip with the ceramic coils. And the new Pax ones I use just always tend to clog up. it's annoying. I'm able to find regular 510 thread carts for cheap cheap here in Cali, so that's what I smoke for convenience. At home Im hitting regular dabs from an e-rig.",2023年4
1347,"yeah blinkers literally exist as a warning to what ur not supposed to do lol, like it’s fun sure but you ruin your pod/cart and ultimately your high just due to the fact that ur burning it to shit and inevitably ruining your hardware.",2023年4

1351,Your right. But a lot of people don't see it that way. So I did the experiment and we came up with this conclusion. I've never done blinkers until this experiment and I'll never do it again,2023年4
1352,"Thanks for the love bro. And you would think this was obvious but there are rookies out there that don't know better. With no common sense. So my wife kinda being one of them lmao.  So we did the experiment.

1357,"Lmao yeah, props for running the experiment and at least trying to figure it out on your own 👏🏻

Definitely some carts try not to get too hot, or even in between blinkers or long hits let it sit for a minute or two, always up right! Standing your carts upright helps the most",2023年4
1358,I know!!!!!!! 🥴,2023年4

1423,"Probably a problem with the battery, all the original colored batteries me or my friends have gotten have been absolute shit, I got an original black one and haven’t had any problems since I got it back in August.

1535,"Alright mate, I recently tried delivery for the first time, I can try to give you the rundown.

It can be quick delivery (within the hours) or scheduled (few hours to days ahead) but the quickest delivery limits what you can buy, based on the dispos options. After you get set up and order, there is an option between standard delivery, discreet delivery, and curbside delivery. There’s also a special instructions area n shit.

With that, I think the best way in your situation would to jus select curbside, n then put a spot on campus where to meet up in the special instruction prompt, then do the process as normal when they come thru.",2023年3
1536,"Since you're picking up weed on a college campus, take a grocery bag, like an opaque plastic bag with you for pick up. Chances are, if you're picking up from stiiizy, they'll use a stiiizy bag to pack your order. So to be discreet, just put the bag in the bag in case a higher-up stops you or sees you. Besides that, you have nothing to worry about. They wont arrive in a ""WEED SOLD HERE"" car or anything lol. And tip your driver in cash  ( only if you want, i just think its kind & makes them happy ) if they do a good job.",2023年3

1544,"YO FUCK THESE NEW PODS. They changed some thing with their manufacturing in the last few months since January and these fuckers don’t work. They keep getting clogged and mine have all that wax down in the bottom like yours. Four out of the six pods I have bought have been bad. And I buy them directly from a Stiiizy dispo. So fucking annoying!! 

I ended up opening up a faulty one the other day, I used pliers to pull the plastic piece off the bottom, and then to pull out the silicone seal, and I let the wax drain out into a small empty wax container for dabs. I put the pod in my car to heat it up using the greenhouse effect so the wax would drain out, if it wasn’t warm enough to that I’d try my toaster oven on a super low setting. 

So getting the wax out…At least I’m not throwing money away since I can use it with my dab rig but  I hate using the torch 🙄 if they don’t  get their shit together and have better pods by the time I’m out of everything I have now, I’m switching to a different pen!! So mad because I’ve been stiiizy gang from the start and it’s honestly disrespectful af to us, their customers, to be putting out such low quality pods. 

Ok. End rant. Sorry🤣",2023年3

1547,"thanks, i do still have the packaging so i will try to return it",2023年3
1548,This only happens to me when I’m smacking the shit outta the pod,2023年3
1549,"Blow outward without the battery. If that doesn’t work, heat it up just a little bit with a lighter. Toke on it until it starts to smoke. This makes it work for the next couple hours for me. I am currently smoking, I believe, king, Louis, and I have to do this to make it work. Even though the oil looks thicker, darker, it still takes me just the same 4 or 5 seconds with the lighter to the plastic area, while you roll it over a couple of times. Of course, not enough to melt it, just to get it warm. Stick it in the battery and smoke it right away.",2023年4
1550,"Bro was fucking furious😭😂 but I 1,000,000% agree with everything u said👍",2023年3
1551,Stiiizy has really been lacking unfortunately. I switched to plugplays and they’re reeeeal nice. Totally recommend. A real shame though because my love for stiiizy was so strong but my cheeks were so sore from sucking out the clogs im tired,2023年3
1552,i bought 2 and within days they both ended up like that^^ it’s annoying. i found that if you put your finger over the holes on the bottom and blow into the mouth until it pops. some wax will come out of the side but it works after,2023年3
1553,since before january on god ! they used to not clog at all smh,2023年3
1554,I tell my wife the same thing,2023年3
1555,Try blowing instead of sucking. They are not the same thing. Lol.,2023年4
1556,"I am!!🤣🤣 Like I said, 4 out of 6 that I purchased last month were faulty, I was ONLY able to finish one without it clogging, and we’ll see how this last one holds up…not cheap, ya know?",2023年3
1557,Bro that’s exactly my story on why I switched to plug play from stiiizy. But just add the fact that plug play just has better oil and hardware overall.,2023年3
1558,"I switched to plugplay as well but maybe it depends on the pods since theres so many, the ones i hit i noticed it hit strong like a vape, but the high wasn't that much stronger than a stiiizy high off 2-3 hits, plugplay u gotta keep hitting that shit but idk",2023年3
1559,"Ughhh dude sorry it’s happening to you, too. Can I ask which state you’re in?

And thanks, I’ll try that!!! Another commenter said that (on another thread the other day) but I wasn’t sure it’d work for such a big ass clog! Thanks also for the heads up about the wax coming out, it’s messy.",2023年3

1563,"It’s what works for me. Or heating up the oil with a lighter. When I did that, it was never too hot to touch, so you don’t have to heat it up much. But twirl it as you do it, so that both sides get heated. Takes about four or five seconds. Put it right in the battery and smoke it. I often have to pull on it six or seven times quickly to get it to start burning. If it still seems clogged, you’re going to have to take my first suggestion. I’ve even dipped a toothpick in alcohol and stuck it down in there, and cleaned out some of the wax that way.",2023年4

1573,"Check my other posts! I have a big one too xD, I bought this one just to get the promo, I had to buy $65 worth of stiiizy products and they'd give me a .5 pineapple express pod for free, so I copped this lil boy since I didn't have one already and got a full gram pod along with it which is the one in the pic, cheers :)",2023年3

If someone knows how to unclog, that’d be cool, but OP…I wouldn’t get your hopes up. I popped the bottom black piece off of a brand new pod that clogged like that last night, pulled out the silicone seal, and I left it to (hopefully) drain into a small glass wax jar…my plan is to use it for dabs so at least I don’t throw money in the trash.",2023年3
1715,If you don’t care about scraping the pod use a vise grip wrench and grab the middle of the pod then use needle nose pliers on the mouth piece and pull it apart then take the rubber part out and clear the wax stuck inside with a tooth pick,2023年3

1760,absolutely… stiiizy has def gone down in quality the past month. My partner had us switch to Play plug and i 100% recommend. Still use my stiiizy since i have 2 gram pods left but they are getting worse and worse imo,2023年3
1761,Yes! This happened to me and i store my pods upright :( burnt so bad.,2023年3
1762,Sucks for me cuz that's my last cart and everything is closed rn and I couldn't have gotten it today cuz I've been at work all day.,2023年3
1763,I kept mine upright with the cap on and everything and still happened,2023年3
1764,that’s sucks bro sorry. maybe try using a tissue and sucking all the oil at the top out. usually what i did when my stiiizy would be all weird n leak/clog,2023年3
1765,Got it to work. But yeah I'm gonna try and get a plug n play tomorrow or technically today if I can,2023年3
1766,dope. hope it all goes well!,2023年3
1767,"I’ve definitely noticed a change in the last few months. I even had a chat with the manager of a stiiizy store about it. It seems to make a bigger difference than ever if you keep your pods upright at all times, and let them warm up in your waistband or pocket, upright obviously, before hitting them. Especially for big hits like blinkers.

If they don’t get it together by the time I’m out of all the pods and wax I have, I’m gonna switch to a different type of pen. Hope I don’t have to!",2023年3
1768,Yeah man. Last few pods have all clogged at halfway through. Sucks,2023年3
1769,It's shit and their stores have started making excuses for not exchanging the broken ones. Switched to plug n play and have enjoyed it about the same or slightly more. Definitely lasts longer without the QC issues,2023年3

1772,bought my very first stiizy this week. Didn’t work. Wouldn’t make a connection. Watched videos. Got it working. Battery light doesn’t change from red even overnight. When it hits it hits hard but I’ll never buy another. Waste of money.,2023年3
1773,Yep I used to only buy Stiiizy but switched to Light Sky Farms live resin carts because Stiiizy became too inconsistent.,2023年3
1774,Has anyone contacted stiiizy directly? Is there a way to do so because these are huge quality control/safety issues,2023年3
1775,"Same issue here. I bought three pods and a starter kit for a trip to try Stiiizy out (normally a Pax Era user) and they all clogged halfway through and started leaking when I tried to clear them with their troubleshooting tips.

Contacted their customer service over a month ago to request an exchange or refund. They asked for pictures and purchase info, and then ghosted me. It’s been over a month now and I email them once a week without response.

Def don’t waste your money with this company. The newest Pax Era pens and cartridges are much more reliable and seemed to have fixed their clogging issue.",2023年4

1920,Effects are solid for a distillate and I have to say it's probably one of the better terpy dominated profiles I've enjoyed from a cart or pod.,2023年3
1921,So if it does pop up “this product is authentic! Enjoy!” It is fake?,2023年3
1922,you got the new v3 packaging and even the new “smooth” hardware. I’d say you’re good,2023年3
1923,Is it orange ?,2023年3
1924,"Yeah, it was my reintroduction to CDT pods after exclusively using their OG line for years … whew. *Definitely* an indica! Try Wedding Cake next if you get a chance.",2023年3
1925,"Nope, that’s real. Fakes that scan will tell you how many times it’s been scanned before",2023年3
1926,"I had a red and a black battery. Both do it, unfortunately. If you're referring to the light indicator itself, no, red.",2023年3
1927,Did there boxes have weed leafs on the corners ? Cuz that’s the only difference I’ve noticed between fake batteries,2023年3
1928,What does the leaf look like? There's leaves all over the front of the box shown in the images.,2023年3
1929,I’m talking bout the battery boxes,2023年3
1930,Oh my bad! I don't have the battery box on me right now but I can check in again soon on that.,2023年3
1931,Yessir it cuz i had the same issue but I got two orange batts Nd they was missing the weed logo on the corner so Iknew they was fake,2023年3
1932,You think I got a fake battery? Weird because the pod I believe to be authentic and I got it from the same shop.,2023年3
1933,I thought that what you was on bro but nevermind bro,2023年3
1934,The battery was like a side commet/concern. OP is is authenticate the pod.,2023年3
1935,"Never seen it like that , mine sometimes leak towards the end but it’s wax idk what this is lmao",2023年3
1936,He pulled out lint out of his pocket,2023年3
1937,"the back qr code isn’t the one for verification purposes, the front scratch off is what does that",2023年3
1938,One time a hacker friend of mine got into stiiizys website VERY easily and gave me a code to put in there and it worked I don’t trust codes just go to a legit shop and stop risking at these trap shops,2023年3
1939,"Biiig isnt 
And the pod depends",2023年3
1940,I entered the serial number from the back manually after opening up the website. It got stuck loading,2023年3
1941,What makes you say the biiig isn’t real?,2023年3
1942,"again, the back qr code is not what you use to verify. it’s the front scratch off verification that does that",2023年3
1943,Does the box have triangles on top of it like the way they wrapped it,2023年3
1944,It doesn’t. Does the box for the pod look real?,2023年3
1945,"We won’t be able to tell until you scratch the front QR code off and scan it [do that first before uploading the results]. You weren’t the type to follow directions in school, huh? The back QR code is internal for Stiiizy inventory/batch ID purposes ffs.",2023年3
1946,I didn’t scratch it off because I wasn’t going to buy them. I was visiting a local smoke shop when I saw these. Getting a Stiiizy has been on the back of my mind for a while now,2023年3
1947,"My bad B I was so fixated on the box itself I didn’t even see the background. I’d check the shop licence info. As long as it matches up with your physical location, the pod × battery setup will probably be legit. As for why the battery box doesn’t have triangles, it may just be an older box. Been smoking on the brand since 2020, they’ve definitely changed the boxes 3/4 times.",2023年3
1948,"well considering you have a fake pod, you probably have a fake bat which would explain why it’s not working properly",2023年3
1949,"Super fake pod, that CA logo is like a cartoon bro. It's probably a dud",2023年3
1950,You’re trying to smoke a bootleg vhs bro,2023年3
1951,Dam whoever sold u that fake pod needs to get smackes,2023年3
1952,"The pod is probably legit, they had those big CA stamps on them before…it’s probably just old…on the other hand, that battery is fake…when u put the pod in the light blinks too fast, I’ve noticed this with the fake batteries…pretty soon if u keep using it the inner casing will pull out when u unplug it from the charger",2023年3
1953,I’m done with Stiiizy.  Just not worth the money.  The carts don’t last even with limited use.  Like they dry up or something.,2023年3
1954,switch to raw gardens they hit me way harder than stiiizys,2023年3
1955,Fake pod,2023年3
1956,"nah, i didn’t even buy the pod or the bat. a friend sent them from cali, sent me like 3 pods too🤦🏽‍♂️",2023年3
1957,"Seconding this, the older pods had bigger CA stamps. I still have mine laying around so can provide photo proof, been too lazy to drop them off at STIIIZY DTLA for recycling",2023年3
1958,"that would make the pod 2+ years old. highly doubt anyone is holding on to old stock THAT long. also would bet money if OP posted a pic of the bottom magnets, they would be big",2023年3
1959,"Touché, these pods move fast on retail side. But if they were sourced from a friend? I’m willing to give the pod the benefit of the doubt, hard to say from OP’s vid. That battery is undoubtedly fake tho.",2023年3
1960,"OP said his homie sent him the battery and pod from cali. if he’s already sending him a fake bat, why would you assume the pod is from early 2020 and legit ? seems like a huge leap of faith there no ?",2023年3
1961,"Cause if they’re actually homies & not just internet strangers surely you’re not gonna do your friends like that? I’m sure he’ll come back into the thread and clear up what the pod bottom looks like. 

If my reasoning don’t make sense it’s bc I slept terribly last night. I don’t usually get migraines & I can’t figure out why I have one now",2023年3
1962,Stiiizy is having a major manufacturing issue. The pods are real but poorly made. I gave up on my Stiiizy vape completely because 3 out of 4 cartridges would clog or leak within two days or opening. I switched to PlugPlay.,2023年3
1963,"I been fucking saying this, it’s their new hardware. That smooth metal bullshit. Never had a problem when I had the sharp edged skinny metal rod batches.",2023年3
1964,"Yepp they’ve been much shittier this last month or so. I’ve considered emailing the company to complain but they already know. 

Tips-

Always always ALWAYS keep your pods upright

Try to warm it up a bit before hitting it- in your pocket, your hands, your waistband, your bra, whatever.  

I bought 5 and 2 leaked. I was able to exchange one but I’m screwed on the 2nd, I’ve been super careful with the 3rd one and so far so good…annoying af though. Hope they get it together by the time I’m ready to buy pods again or maybe I’ll just switch to dabs for a while.",2023年3
1965,Always keep them up right and try to save the ripper cap this helps so much but yes i agree the pods have gone down in quality the past year,2023年3
1966,"plugplay needs to come to michigan, because i'm tired of this shit too",2023年3
1967,pods/carts don’t go bad. idk who told you that they only last 10 months but that’s not true. thc just degrades into cbn (sleepy cannabinoid) over time so the pod will hit more like a heavy indica,2023年3
1968,"Stiiizy store sells old ones like that all of the time.

It still has drugs in it you will still get high. 

Stiiizys get clogged ALOT. There will be times where you  hit it but you actually don't get any product. 

Make sure it isn't clogged. Make sure you hear the coil cracking (vaporizing the oil, sounds like bacon cooking) 

There's nothing wrong with an old pod",2023年3
1969,"No one told me that, I just noticed that the older they get the less potent they are. With the old ones I had I didn’t get high no matter how many times I hit it. 

When would it begin to degrade? On first use or from when it was made? Do you know how long it takes until the degradation becomes noticeable?",2023年3
1970,Copy that! Thank u,2023年3
1971,If you're not getting high no matter how many times you hit it then there's something wrong. Either your tolerance is thru the roof which happens when you vape concentrates a lot. Or maybe you're not hitting it right 🤷‍♂️,2023年3
1972,What this man said I wouldn’t be too worried. I’ve been sold year old pods before. They still smack like a mf,2023年3
1973,"Hmmm probably not hitting it right. I’m a lightweight lol.

Inhale into mouth, then into lungs?",2023年3
1974,Yeeeeeeeeet,2023年3
1975,"Yeah just don't be scared of it. You don't have to take massive hits or anything like that. Make sure it lights up for like 2 seconds while inhaling into your mouth (like drinking from a straw). Then take a second DEEP relaxing inhale. Take it easy, go your own pace and you'll be good 😊",2023年3
1976,Love it. Thank you !,2023年3
1977,should be good. that’s been an ongoing issue with their verification system for some time now,2023年3
1978,LR berry pies pretty nice I have one rn,2023年3
1979,Looks fake,2023年3
1980,"u have to scan the scratch off code not the qr on the back, if that’s what u did",2023年3
1981,"the dark spot is just oxidized oil, happens over time. keep your pods upright so the oil can settle at the bottom so you won’t burn your pods",2023年3
1982,"Looks fake. The color of mine is super light, almost clear",2023年3
1983,Actually it looks like it’s been tampered with. Just because it comes from a dispensary doesn’t mean staff tampering can’t happen. Like personally I prefer Sunnyside. Everything is always sealed and full. I went to Missouri and nothing was tamper resistant sealed and their products sucked like street grade.,2023年3
1984,"My .5 biscotti looked like that but my 1g never do, I wonder if it’s an old batch, I didn’t even think to look",2023年3
1985,Thanks for that but doesn’t it seem weird that all 3 of the pods I got from a dispensary are all like this I got them 4 days ago,2023年3
1986,All 3 .5g pods were from the stiiizy store in Michigan,2023年4
1987,Did you take it back to the shop? Most shops will accept exchanges usually within 7 days if it hasn't been smoked over half way in most cases.,2023年3
1988,I did and they gave me store credit. That level of customer service is a reason I shop where I shop,2023年3
1989,"Yes that is the correct site. Been seeing many similar posts showing scanned 1 time before the persons original scan. Stiiizy says its a glitch, sadly seems they have no intent to fix it.",2023年3
1990,You’re fine,2023年3
1991,Fake ones will have thousands of verifications,2023年3
1992,Your first mistake was buying Biscotti 🤮,2023年3
1993,[deleted],2023年3
1994,They prolly starting to backdoor more👀,2023年3
1995,Fr thats the worst strain of all time haha,2023年3
1996,How you know it’s fake ?,2023年3
1997,"I believe it has to do with time zones and computers, causing the first verification to actually look in the past.",2023年3
1998,Lol why is biscotti bad? I’ve never tried it.,2023年3
1999,"is it cdt? those hit wayyy harder in my opinion. were you drunk before? any blood thinners like medication? those all make u feel way higher, maybe really hungry/thirsy even?",2023年3
2000,Yeah the dream walker CDT on the Biig sent me flying once and I was caught very off guard,2023年4
2001,this comment just saved me lol,2023年3
2002,where’d you get this pod ? this is the v3 packaging but in the batch id it says v2. this would be the first counterfeit of this new packaging that i’ve seen,2023年3
2003,Did you get it from a dispensary? What website did the QR code take you.,2023年3
2004,"I scanned my stiiizy pod when I bought it yesterday and it said that is been verified like over 9,000 times…I still hit the pod and got a great high nothing not normal",2023年3
2005,"Throw it away please, mine said same thing still smoked, wasn't as strong high, ended up with major lung damage, I have no clue if they correlate but don't want you to go through the same",2023年3
2006,"yes, there’s no known counterfeits of these. edibles don’t have the scratch off verification, only the pods do",2023年3
2007,"If you can get the ones from stiiizy direct ( so you know they are legit )
Sooo fire!",2023年3
2008,"it looks like the Caribbean breeze gummy packaging? i remember buying from stiiizy last year around 4/20, it’s like a triangle packaging but now their gummies are in little jars. id say legit",2023年3
2009,"I wonder why they'd have a QR that goes nowhere then?

I pasted it into a ""broken QR"" reader and it just returned a number not even a url so I'm still confused",2023年3
2010,I don't think they'll ship to NYC? I've looked on their site and seems like they and other weed shops don't want to even try shipping to places where it's not fully legal yet.,2023年3
2011,"I tried those too. They have jars and the triangles. In the jar they're little rectangles and are 100mg instead of 90.

They sell them on their site in the same packaging, but since the QR code doesn't scan and the serial number doesn't give a result, they might be fake.

The ones I've tried so far seem to work but I hear some illegal products in NY have been laced with heroin or fentanyl and I'm not trying to be a real druggie",2023年3
2012,Doesn’t New York have a stiiizy nowadays?,2023年3
2013,Not yet New York only recently legalized they are still in the process of handing out licenses we don’t even have any official recreational dispensary yet let alone a stiiizy licensed in New York in couple years hopefully,2023年3
2014,Damn! Hopefully you guys get it soon!,2023年3
2015,Ever since Stiiizy started expanding into other states and growing manufacturing their QC has gone to shit. All of the last 6 pods I’ve purchased have had the same issues OP mentions. I’m ready to move onto a new brand who actually cares about their product and user experience.,2023年2
2016,"yeah this is such a big issue recently, thinking of switching to PlugnPlay",2023年2
2017,"QC issue but a way to fix it is use pliers to rip off the mouth piece. Take the rubber piece out where the wax is stored. Then just simply put it back together, doing this kind of ""resets"" it and it wont be clogged anymore",2023年2
2018,"I recently switched from Stiiizy CDT pods to Light Sky Farms' live resin pods.  Mainly due to reasons OP stated, Stiiizy pods were just no longer consistent :(  and previously Stiiizy was the only brand I would buy, I think stuff like Platinum and Common Citizen are poison. Stiiizy hasn't stooped to their levels but I felt I just wasn't getting my money's worth from their pods anymore. The LSF pods are only half gram and finish pretty quickly but I at least feel like I'm getting every last drop of it before it's done.",2023年3
2019,mine wouldn’t get clogged that much so it’s kinda rare but i do get the hot wax getting in my mouth which is ass . i usually hit it real slow for that reason but i get some in my mouth still sadly . idk what’s going on 🤔 .,2023年3
2020,"Warm the pod/cart. I'll take a lighter and wave it around the pod/cart to get it warmed up, then use the preheat option if available, repeat until it hits easily without sucking hard. This way you get a good hit and no wax comes out, just vapor. I've found this to work on all of my carts and pods, regardless of brand.",2023年3
2021,"bro, fr. I’m tired of getting that little dot of warm wax on my lip & then fuzzy stuff gets stuck to it. >,< other than plug n plays… what’s another good alternative to stiiizy? specifically the CDT pods.",2023年3
2022,I came to this sub to see if it’s just me before stop buying completely lmao. Any suggestions on other brands,2023年3
2023,Same here. I got tired of pretty much every pod clogging.  I moved on to the 510 threaded carts.,2023年2
2024,Really sucks that a general rule in the cannabis industry seems to be that expansion = ensuing decrease in quality,2023年3
2025,"No lie, just tried this and loving plug n play. CDT we're my jam, but the clogging and subsequent fall of their customer service made me switch it up",2023年2
2026,"PlugPlay? That’s new, is it available in Michigan?",2023年2
2027,"I’ll try that, thank you!",2023年2
2028,how long are your lsf pods lasting? my half g stiiizy pods last like 3 days min.. 6 days max 😭😭,2023年3
2029,Yup. Those are smooth.,2023年3
2030,i dont think so. it’s definitely in CA so i think it will be soon,2023年2
2031,Try Light Sky Farms if you're looking for a Stiiizy substitute available in Michigan,2023年3
2032,They’re the old line of flower. Check package dates on any you see,2023年2
2033,My favorite!,2023年2
2034,Distillate with added terpenes.,2023年2
2035,What is the different effect of cdt and regular thc? I wanna get a new pod and strawberry shortcake cdt interested me,2023年3
2036,what about it,2023年3
2037,honestly  the cdt is mostly about flavor for me… and maybe a slightly different high due to the way you feel from natural terpenes. I definitely feel a difference between the high on the live resin vs the disty pods. For me the high on the LR is cleaner and less heavy/sleepy feeling.,2023年3
2038,That's what you purchased,2023年3
2039,"i know what i purchased

Edit: it literally says it on the box",2023年3
2040,You should go to the doctor.,2023年2
2041,You sir had a syncoptic episode,2023年2
2042,No. You didn't pass out from weed.,2023年2
2043,Try switching to flower for a bit. I smoked everyday and I feel when I’ve only been smoking my stiiizy pod I get agitated easily.,2023年2
2044,Are you over weight?,2023年2
2045,"No, I ate an apple today",2023年3
2046,This,2023年2

2050,🤣🤣🤣🤣,2023年2
2051,"No, I actually would say I’m above average when it comes to health aside from my weed habit,( <15% body fat)",2023年3
2052,I warm my cold carts up once they start clogging. It seems to work. A pocket that keeps it upright is the ticket.,2023年2
2053,"Stiiizy is having a major problem with these cartridges. Mine kept clogging, leaking or pooling at the bottom. The pooling caused the battery to overheat. The dispensary I go to said that so many people have been coming in for exchanges with the same issues. I switched over to PlugPlay. Good luck.",2023年2
2054,happened to me too a few months ago. couldn’t take having my pods wasted due to bubbling out the top. so i switched to carts.,2023年2
2055,"To fix that from happening try taking shorter hits and longer breaks in between, when your pod is almost empty the oil heats up faster and causes it to bubble it is basically a liquid at that point and it flows and gets clogged in the mouth part so the next time you hit it try Plugging the bottom with your finger and blowing until it unclogs, some might spill out the side air holes but this is much less than eating the nasty ass tasting dab",2023年2
2056,Have you tried taking dry hits when it’s clogged? It seems a lot more people have been having a problem with the pods doing this. I’ve been using a stiiizy for about four years now though and always had this problem with them clogging and found dry hits (inhaling without the battery) usually worked unclog. You’ll be able to hear when it unclogs. best of luck,2023年2
2057,Yup I switched to select and raw garden carts for that exact reason.,2023年2
2058,"I agree plug play never has this issue. My only complain is plug and play goes by so quick i do enjoy their oil it taste like candy but it is quite harsher than stiizy oil on my throat, I hope they fix this issue soon",2023年2
2059,It is stronger for sure. It got me with a really harsh hit the first time. I was used to a big inhale with stiiizy. I started taking smaller hits and that was much better. The high is much higher than Stiiizy for me.,2023年2

2062,I bought a currated live resin jar and the qr code doest work either. It just loads and loads I don't know why. It sure look official too.,2023年3
2063,Got that too - bought mine from a dispo as well. They gave me a full refund and let me keep it.,2023年5
2064,Seems like everyone is saying as long as you purchased from a reputable or licensed place you should be good.,2023年3
2065,"you’re good. this has been an issue with their verification system for almost a year now. if you’re buying from licensed dispensaries, you have nothing to worry about",2023年2

2071,did they ever email you back and how long ago did you email them?,2023年2

what you have there is from michigan which is why it doesn’t have a california cannabis warning on it. never seen a counterfeit MI stiiizy only ever counterfeit CA ones. this one looks good

2145,2nd fake stiiizy pod from my dispensary and idk if its them or stiiizy to blame,2023年2
2146,definitely the dispensary to blame. Stiiizy doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that they sell fake vapes!,2023年2
2147,You're not going to find that shit bruh. It's probably just disty and terps. Stiiizy isn't going to put that shit out because it would allow people to copy them and probably also ruin the idea that they're something special.,2023年2
2148,"Ingredients are as follows, Cannabis Distillate, Terpenes. Hope that helps!",2023年2

2169,Metal detectors didn't do anything?,2023年2
2170,What kind of wallet do you have?,2023年4
2171,No 1:1s in Michigan as far as I’m aware. And I don’t believe the use fillers besides the botanically derived terpenes. Could be wrong,2023年2
2172,Stiiizy has one 1:1 strain (at least they used to in Michigan); it’s called Mango.,2023年2
2173,They do not use fillers just distillate and CBD,2023年3
2174,That’s awesome.  My family loves them.  Just want something that’s clean.,2023年3
2175,"Distillate is prob the lowest form of cannabis concentrate, you want the best stuff around then your looking for live rosin or other concentrates like live resin. They’re more smoother and easier on your lungs and throat. Distillate tends to make bigger clouds but with live resin you’ll get taste and quality. Live rosin is mostly for dabbing but it can’t be found in pens just have to look.",2023年3
2176,Yes live resin is my choice of vape.  My wife and son love stiiizy.  I like a Stiiizy hit here and there but I consider it cannabis “lite”.  I also use a Storz and Bickel dry vape.  Just don’t like combustion,2023年3
2177,"Honestly I think they are aware at least partially 

I recently found a old stiiizy cart from a little over a year ago (I used to burn my carts when first using stiiizy) while cleaning and compared it to last month’s cart and it looks on the bottom they like got rid of a small structural piece that surrounds the metal bit underneath the holes for the wick, that looks like it keeps it from leaking so easily. With inflation rising my theory is that they’re most likely trying to cut corners to profit more or maybe it’s only happening in a select production factories",2023年2
2178,"From what I've gathered, the stores are more of a franchise system. I was told rewards don't carry between stores so this would be the only way that makes sense to me.

In which case, seems like quality control issues on the individual stores. I actually buy direct from the stiiizy shop in Barstow CA and I've never had a leaky or bad pod. Could be bad handling of product.",2023年2
2179,I get pods from Michigan and for about a year I've been getting them I've never had a pod leak,2023年2
2180,same i’m disappointed in them. been on stizz for 2 years and have just switched to carts bc of my pods always leaking. it’s sad bc i really loved the stiiizy brand,2023年2
2181,Do u get a discount when you buy in bulk?,2023年2
2182,I only buy half grams because I know I have a hot piece of metal in a plastic box and that shits gonna wear down fast. Also never hit blinkers,2023年2
2183,"yeah i finally ditched stizy after using them for like 4 years. leaky pods, poor pod-battery connections even on new products, etc. i invested in a plug play and while they’re more expensive, the hit harder and are more well made than stiz.",2023年2
2184,"So what do you think best way to avoid leaking? I know someone who always stores back in the box and has it standing vertically. And claims it helps prevent it. 
But I smoke too much to put back and forth in the box lol.",2023年2
2185,"Stiizy is trash if you asked me. Employee at an official Stiizy store said we aren’t allowed to talk about the jeeter pre roll class action lawsuit. I was trying to find out if it came out that someone was just talking trash, or really a thing, and he was actually rude about it. Super disappointed that I got to my car and found that half of my pods were oxidized. My brother took them back inside and asked them about the oxidation, and guess what: they aren’t allowed to talk about that either, but he will check with his manager. When he came back he still wasn’t allowed to talk about it, but my brother could switch them out if he wants. This was at official stiizy in Detroit.",2023年3
2186,Yeah you end up saving About 50 bucks it's 5 pods for 200 bucks or what that equates to is buy 4 and get 1 free.,2023年2
2187,I have come to learn hitting blinkers does burn a lot.,2023年2
2188,"you’re good, it’s legit. new packaging and verification checks out",2023年2
2189,🙏🏼🙏🏼,2023年2
2190,I saw the same document! Hopefully we get a stiiizy store soon 🤞🏿 I saw the application was approved in September so maybe sooner than we think,2023年2
2191,I’ve been smoking their pods for since high school and their quality has declined significantly over the years I switched over the plug plays amazing so far they haven’t failed for the past 3 years,2023年2
2192,"I for real am so pissed at these things. Brand new cartridge, and the thing doesn't even work. It got so hot the liquid came out the top and burned my tongue and now is stuck to the inside of my mouth. Why tf to people even buy these? They are trash and taste like trash. They don't even work! wtf. I couldn't even get 1 hit off a brand new cartridge.",2023年2
2193,Are you taking repetitive blinkers or hitting it back to back? Saw some people mention that it can lead to clogs. Was having a similar issue recently and noticed the clogs were less frequent when I didn't put it in my pocket right away and didn't take back to back hits.,2023年2
2194,mine did this too but i also would take a lot of consecutive hits. i try to keep it away from heat so away from the heaters in my car. also try to keep it standing up! this also helps,2023年2
2195,My best advice stop buying stiiizy. Maybe take it back to the shop with your receipt and say your cart is defective. Their quality control had gone way down.,2023年2
2196,"Same, I've been using Stiiizy for 4 years now and before 6 months ago, I had 1 defective pod. I've had 2 that were about a 1/3 left that clogged and/or leaked and I've got 3 that are almost full and completely forked.

I've tried everything, I'm taking these 3 back next time I go and gonna switch to something else until they get their quality control in check or whatever the issue is. (I know what I'm switching to I just don't want this to come off as negging Stiiizy to promote another brand).

Super bummed, Stiiizy really has helped me.",2023年2
2197,Still buying stiiizy,2023年2
2198,You didn’t do anything wrong I wonder if stiiizy sees all these post.,2023年2
2199,"Your getting it too hot

Leaking pods/carts are 98% caused by user error. 

Passing around a group of people. Chain vaping, etc. any pod or cart should have a 30 second break (at least) between hits. 

Can I get a bunch of down votes now please 🙏",2023年2
2200,Just stop buying stiiizy fr it’s not worth the money,2023年2
2201,This happened to me too a lot recently. I don’t have a solution but I did switch to different carts besides stiiizys and I’ve been problem free since.,2023年2
2202,You bought a stiiizy pod. That’s what you did wrong. Their company doesn’t care about their product anymore and is totally fine with scamming addicts who won’t switch to a better brand. Don’t buy stiiizy they’re pieces of shit garbage product.,2023年2
2203,"Here is what I do, but I cannot say that it is a permanent fix. Toothpicks, alcohol. Dip the toothpick in the alcohol and stick it in the mouthpiece part right in the center. Push it down and spin it. Keep doing this with a clean, alcohol-soaked toothpick until the point does not stick in there anymore. BLOW through the mouthpiece until it lets you do so freely. It took a while for some of them. Before putting it back in the battery, make sure you can suck and blow air through the mouthpiece. To help keep it from getting clogged again, but this is not an exact science, blow through the mouthpiece from time to time. Every time I smoke, I blow through the mouthpiece before I set it down. I have yet to throw a pod out. But I have been very frustrated through this. I learned the blowing part from a YouTube video. The alcohol and toothpick were my last resort. But I have done it more than once to at least one of the pods I have. Virtually all of mine are 1 g.",2023年2
2204,"I've consistently been getting pods doing this lately as well. I DID realize though what some people are saying is true, and that constant overuse back to back can cause it. It's honestly simple science none of us consider. But there are also still times where you just get a shit pod no matter what you do.  So yes, always remove pod from battery and keep upright and also don't charge it with the pod in just in case, but don't keep taking those back to back to back to back constant hits. The overheating and drawing pulls the wax up through the holes.",2023年2
2205,I love Stiiizy pods but due to not hitting and clogging I’ve given up. Not worth the frustration.,2023年2
2206,"The only time I usually pull for a long time is trying to get it to start after being clogged, and not pulling super hard either, just enough to get the light to come on. Not doing back to back hits makes sense. I’ve definitely taken hits one after the other.",2023年2
2207,Idk i disagree that pods haven’t always been kinda shitty. I used to use my stiiizy a lot more about 4 years back as well and my pods would ALWAYS get clogged (half full or even full) although it seemed to be more of a problem with the half gram pods. At the time I was making okay $ and didn’t care so I’d toss them lol,2023年2
2208,"I won't downvote you, but you have to admit, the amount of people complaining about clogged, defective, leaking carts has spiked recently, wouldn't you agree? So the previous 4 years I used Stiiizy problem free, I was in the 98%, but the last 6 months I am in the 2%? Not to mention all the friends who I've got bum carts for also...

Somethings up and I agree, most are user error, but nah, it's happening way too frequently now.",2023年2

2213,"Keep upright, don’t overheat, patience, and don’t suck it like a thick milkshake… it should be just fine if you follow these simple things. 

In 10 years of using carts and pods, I have had maybe under 10 ever have a problem and I think that’s stretching it. 

These are just my experience and opinion of course.",2023年2
2214,I have a 510 battery now and ever since I made the switch I’ve had zero issues. Stiiizys QC has gone down significantly over the past few years,2023年2

2349,Yikes goodluck with that,2023年2
2350,Why is the sticker BLUE?,2023年2
2351,No way batch info always stickers on back with QR code and I know the sticker on front varies by state but that one’s just wrong 🤣,2023年2

2370,chief it dawg,2023年2
2371,Warm it up with a blow dryer and put it on your battery. Stick the stiiizy upside down in a tube sock and spin that thing like crazy. You gotta get the pod warm enough though.,2023年2

2386,My phone is messed up the camera shakes that’s why it looks like that,2023年2
2387,Cannabis derived terpenes just means the tastes are strain specific and the terpenes (flavor) are coming from the specific plant..definitely give it a try,2023年2
2388,Is coo more turtle content tho?,2023年2
2389,Oh damn definitely going to try them next time thanks 👍🏽,2023年2
2390,If y’all want had her since I was 9 now I’m 18 lol,2023年2
2391,"Take it a step further get cured resin or live resin, some affordable choices; coldfire (catalyst dispensaries, 45$ Sundays they 15% off) alien labs 22-32$ for cured or live resin Same goes for connected California but out of my range I’ve seen these more expensive for some reason, but then there’s also plug plays which hit bit more than stizzys, there’s raw garden live resin+ cdt, then buddies cdt, live resin diamonds, or distillate all the above range from $22-38 + depending if there’s deals, crescos usually cheap live resin def worth a shot
(just recommendations)",2023年2
2392,Yea I fw live resin a lot but I get it delivered from stizzy cus where I live there no dispensaries out here so most of the time I spend alot just on a few pods,2023年2
2393,"That cdt pod is def worth it, it’s preference tho. It’s regular distillate but the taste is real earthy and piney it has like a real earthy og taste to it. I think they’re on par with live resin tbh they hit harder in my opinion",2023年3
2394,Live Resin pods are full spectrum. CDT and OG pods are THC focused and are made of distillate.,2023年2
2395,unfortunately fake. old packaging yet claims to be made in 2022 and batch ids read incorrectly,2023年2
2396,Fake,2023年2

2400,"They told me this months ago, word for word same response, and yet…. it is still happening lol",2023年2
2401,Lmfao sounds about right. They don't wanna take accountability I guess. I'll just try one of the hundreds of new companies coming out daily since I live in California and not Michigan or some shit 😂,2023年2
2402,"cool find bro!  


fyi they ain’t worth it if ur the one paying",2023年2
2403,The solventless carts are whack and all over NYC now,2023年2
2404,is it just me or the original stiizy the best? i’ve tried the resin one and this one and i don’t think the high is nearly as good as a plain old reg stiizy. so odd,2023年2
2405,Good find. These ones don’t clog easy ( for me),2023年2
2406,"
Do they have cdt pods?",2023年2
2407,Honestly same kinda wack,2023年2
2408,Whats wrong with solventless? Im only on the normal pods so idk what the differences are,2023年2
2409,"Nah you’re trippin, CDT and live resin are ⛽️",2023年2
2410,their actual rosin dabs r pretty good tho,2023年2
2411,U can only smoke the pod for 3 seconds or it will burn and the entire pod will taste burnt. Then u have to wait ten minutes before taking another. Stiiizy recommends only using on the small battery . All this info comes on a lil piece of paper in the solventless pack. They aren’t worth it imo,2023年2
2412,i haven’t tried the CDT have to do that any strain suggestion? live resin i’m still ehh about maybe i gotta try them again,2023年2
2413,Ah i see. Well thanks for the heads up. Thought of getting one myself but I only have a big bat so not trying to get a whole different bat to not mess up a solventless,2023年2
2414,Any of the strains lol… you may have gotten a fake live resin because they absolutely slap,2023年2
2415,"also they have a much lower thc percentage, which is good for some ppl … but def not me lol",2023年2
2416,Thats interesting considering in ny they are more then the regular pods,2023年2
2417,obviously it has lower thc percentage cuz it’s not just about thc. There’s actual terps in it. Ever heard of the entourage effect?,2023年2
2418,"yeah I’m in NY too, super overpriced… I’ve seen shops ask $75 for em",2023年2
2419,[deleted],2023年2
2420,Damn. Ive seen em for 80. Talk about a pricey pod for less thc. What are even the benefits then that make em more expensive,2023年2
2421,That’s not really what the entourage effect is. It’s more so about how terps have a synergistic effect with delta 9. And it’s likely you burnt the pod which is why they say to not rip it for long,2023年2
2422,It’s live rosin which is usually amazing. But stiiizy batteries don’t have a temp control and live rosin is supposed to be smoked at a low temperature so these just kinda fall short smh,2023年2
2423,Mames sense,2023年2
2424,💕,2023年2
2425,this is amazing ong,2023年2
2426,Do they sell'em instore?,2023年2
2427,yea it’s definitely real you can tell by the coil,2023年2
2428,Idk Cuz but it looks like you went to a basketball court and threw it on the ground wit all dem scratches,2023年2
2429,"i think that’s from being in my bag, wasn’t like that when i first opened pid",2023年2
2430,that’s oxidation. nothing to worry about,2023年2
2431,It’s probably a little bit older a lot of my .5s look like that and I’ve had hundreds,2023年2
2432,"“Oxidation, a chain reaction that occurs in the presence of oxygen, is responsible for the deterioration in the quality of food products, including off-flavors and off-odors.”— from googling does oxidation affect flavor. For the prices stiiizy charges we shouldn’t be getting oxidized pods from them unless they are marked down. Smoke shop in my area that are shysters even marks their oxidized delta 8 carts down 50% when they get like that.",2023年3
2433,STIIIZY is privately owned...,2023年2
2434,You don’t have a link or sauce for this do ya…?,2023年2
2435,I don’t believe you can buy shares of cannabis companies in the US. Although I could be wrong,2023年2
2436,As a employee I’ve heard rumors about this as well. Not sure if it’s true but it definitely makes sense the company gets worse and worst day by day.,2023年2

2444,The greatest wax pen in existence,2023年2
2445,"Yes and no. The parent company Altria invested in Cronos (Canadian), but Marlboro was staying out of the industry. It looks like they finally stepped in and it is ruining stiiizy’s reputation",2023年2
2446,I've never experienced that. I've had many pods and they've all been great. I can't wait till they release solventless pods,2023年2
2447,"Plug and play are good but I did notice they do burn faster than stiiizy, pax era pods or 510 carts.",2023年2
2448,Solventless? Wdym? Also thank you so much for your assistance,2023年2
2449,Plug play wax is distillate or live resin,2023年2
2450,"I have the same problem. My gf bought me one a couple days ago, and I hooked it up to an android charger I had accessible. The next morning, it was still red, so I looked online and it stated to use the wire it came with. It has now been charging over 24 hours on the original wire. Still red. Did yours ever turn white?",2023年2
2451,that’s not a hole and those notches have always been there,2023年2

2454,Once u rip let it sit for 5 and cool down,2023年2
2455,how do you hit it? bc 99% of the time clogs are user error.,2023年2
2456,"Man fuck these stiiizy shills in the comments. Their quality has gone super down dude i dont know why. I recommend trying new cart companies bro. I stopped buying stiiizy maybe 2 or 3 months ago because i kept getting defective carts too. Try out plug n play, honestly they almost hit too hard.

Ive really been liking abx carts. Absolute xtracts. Theyre really good. And they have another sub brand called loud + clear. Ive been buying those carts and they been getting me fucked up.",2023年2
2457,Bro how do ppl keep having clogging problems? Are u making sure u have a legit stiiizy pod not the black market ones that are everywhere? Also keep that shit away from heat. That seems to be the #1 cause if they are legit stiiizys,2023年2
2458,"pnp is way better, i had 3 pods my last reup, 2 out of 3 pods were fucked is why i will never get a stiiizy again. 710labs also has really good pods if you can get your hands onem",2023年2

2462,"regardless of whether it is user error or not, it says a lot about the quality of a product based off how easy it is for a user to make such an error",2023年2
2463,Ehat is then proper way to hit these? I just got my first stiizy about a week ago and it’s been working fine for the most part. There are just some times that I feel that I have to take a hit to kind of warm it up first. Like I’ll take my first hit of the night and don’t get much but afterwards it’ll be fine. Is that normal?,2023年2
2464,"facts, there’s some stiiizy fanboys in here that don’t like what you’re saying though lol",2023年2
2465,"I've never had one clog. I don't do anything fancy. They always require warming because it's wax, the shit is sticky, but one it's warmed up, hits are easy and all you do is drag. In order to warm it up, all you have to do is take a few light drags and it clears what I'm assuming yall think are clogs",2023年2
2466,"Thats fine man. We're all welcome to opinion. Ive probably spent over a thousand on stiiizy carts if i think how many ive bought over the years. So my opinions plenty valid. Dont tell someone oh its how you hit it. You dont see that shit coming out the mouthpiece. We gotta acknowledge all these posts that iron works collective (the people that actually make the carts for stiiizy) been fucking up. Their lil rubber seals inside, the quality of them must be off or something i dont know. Theyve lost me as a customer.",2023年2
2467,"Me as well. Quality used to be so much better even with glass jars with bud, after they switched to mylar packs bud was so stale.",2023年2
2468,Oh dude you know i havent purchased their bud in a while. But when it was in glass. Wow it was super fresh and high quality and the couple shops around me that had it. They were reasonably priced compared to other dank 8ths for sale lol. I saw in another post that they come in mylar now and seen that people say its stale. Thats unfortunate. Their bud was top notch. Wonder why they cheaped out on the glass jars.,2023年2
2469,have you seen the post where workers mention how they were being treated?,2023年2
2470,Yeah i did how one shop didnt have the ac on when it was hot as shit. Then another stiiizy in a different parts of cali was like whaddaya mean we got ac all the time. Real weird behavior.,2023年2
2471,They just got in the market in NV and they treat us like shit here too,2023年3
2472,"it’s real. this is just a glitch in the system, obviously the pod can’t be verified in the future",2023年2
2473,When u scan it is verifies and then u press it again and it said 2 time u r good,2023年2
2474,I had one that said it had been verified 16k times. Yikkks,2023年2

2478,also my the pods look very different but I didn't verify the last one,2023年2

2486,I thought that's what happened lol! 😭,2023年2
2487,not sure sorry!!,2023年2
2488,Think they just updated their hard ware,2023年2
2489,They are in cali,2023年2
2490,"that wasn’t a real, licensed dispensary. it was an unlicensed dispensary aka trap shop. legit dispensaries will not get fake product, they buy directly from the brands distributors",2023年2
2491,everything we can see looks good. he’s got both v2 and the new v3 packaging so that’s a good sign as well. I’d buy one and scratch and make sure the verification is good,2023年2
2492,Not sure if Caption is readable but.. is there any way to LC these just from the packaging?? Ive been a victim for buying cakes and muhas and dont wanna fall for some boof ass vapes again (Plug selling these also sells cakes btw),2023年2
2493,Keep It somewhere cold somewhere for like a couple hours …  i was able to make mine taste unburnt after burning it on a small pod cuz i thought it was a regular pod in there but i forgot to a switch it 🤷🏻,2023年2
2494,Sweet! thanks for the tip. I thought I was gonna have to trash the thing. Really didn’t wanna do that considering how expensive they are.,2023年2
2495,"i meant on a small battery* but yeah u should be fine … they are def pricy. I prefer the live resin or cdt pods for sure and if i want solventless i go for the 710 labs pods, which are amazing.",2023年2

2564,They said they were legit. They switched the pod supplier and they had issues but they fixed them now with the new batches. They said if it's a licensed place then it's legit.,2023年5
2565,awe where did S14-Silvia go? talking all that smack just because i corrected him sayin this is a real pod while he claimed it’s fake. sayin i buy mine off the black market like okay weirdo. i purchase mine from a local cali dispo but you claiming it’s fake makes it seem like you get fake podz LOL,2023年2
2566,The sticker is fading which is good(supposed to happen). The oil looks good so I think your vibing do u know if your friend scanned it before? This is just my thoughts I would wait for a few more inputs on this post,2023年2

2632,yeah bro one thing u can rely on is the bottom of the pod .  if the magnets are bigger than the real ones like in the pic then yeah that shit fake .,2023年1
2633,"afaik, their difference lies in the extraction process which is why their terpene concentration is still different even though they're stored the same. [live resin](https://www.medicalterpenes.com/live-resin-explained/) is extracted directly from fresh materials while thc comes from a distillation process. i did a quick google search and i think the graph from this blog can help for better visualization of the process: [https://thebloombrands.com/2021/08/10/live-resin-vs-distillate/](https://thebloombrands.com/2021/08/10/live-resin-vs-distillate/)",2023年1

So I suggest throwing it on the charger to top it off for an hour and 5min max then pull it off the plug (unless it isn’t white then wait still) then once ur done pull the pod out and put it back into the battery, this has fixed it for every time I have not got the fat cloud rips.",2023年1

2693,"Hahaha no discipline, I just like smoking flower a lot more than vaping.

 I used to go through 2 or 3 full gram pods a week, my tolerance got to a point where I was barely feeling high anymore so i cut back and replaced with flower 😂 I still enjoy the occasional puff tho, don’t get me wrong",2023年1

2699,Ironworks collective manufacturing. But In your case use bread wire and stick in the hole and leave it there. Move it when your about to hit but stop hitting it if it looks like that. I just hate that I can’t keep a Stiiizy in my pocket and hit it naturally. If these pods suck try the solvent less pods they didn’t clog on me but not as potent.,2023年1
2700,"This is bc your pod got too hot. This happens to me when I accidentally pass out with it and it gets hot with my body heat. It starts to clog and it sucks, but the only way to avoid it is just be mindful of leaving it near anything warm for too long",2023年1
2701,do You take a lot of blinkers,2023年1
2702,"It’s 10000% related to heat exposure. 

I posted about this and maybe 10+ people all agreed  in the stiiizy Reddit here that theirs was also leaking out the top due to the higher temps in our homes cars offices jobs etc etc. like I was sitting in my car freezing blasting 99* degree hot air in my face to warm me up while I’m taking blinkers (that means long hits to the OP) in the heat of my car was instantly the cause of the oil coming up the mouthpiece. 

I also use to keep a separate stiiizy in my room but under the heater vent and after I run the heater all day then go to smoke and my pen was sitting under the heat exhaust outlet so it also then caused it to come up the mouthpiece.

Once I recognized his I stopped the heat and kept it away from the stiiizy completely and haven’t had oil come out the mouthpiece ever since I became more self aware of where I put my shit, like these motherfuckers are very sensitive to heat unfortunately. So do ur best to keep it upright still always but in a cold dark place when not hitting it. (And never in ur pocket all day that’s not good)",2023年1
2703,Dope I'll look into it,2023年1
2704,?,2023年1
2705,I don’t know if it’s heat causing it unless only the newer pods are vulnerable. I had no issues keeping mine in a 100+ degree car last summer yet most pods I’ve gotten since late Nov have had issues.,2023年1
2706,A blinker is when you inhale on your vape to the point that the led ( whether its the illuminated button or power demonstration light ) flashes to show the battery has been exhausted for that puff. Typically a 7-11 second inhale on common vapes.,2023年1

2720,just keep it stored upright and u should be bubble free,2023年1
2721,normally that’s what it looks like in the top of your pod but seems the bubble moved because you don’t keep it upright. definitely keep upright when at home,2023年1

2766,"Yeah, obviously not the stiiizy tho",2023年5
2767,"Bro I won’t lie.. I had ice cream cake that was fucking amazing tasting just like ALL the CDTs are. But it’s funny you say that cause recently I had one ice cream cake pod taste a kinda funky once when I got it recently.. but it seemed literally it was just that batch cause I didn’t order that strain for about another month then it went back to that same amazing taste from when I first tried it. 

This ALSO happened with strawberry shortcake flavor cdt I thought it tasted exactly like Jack Herer and fuckin piney and skunky and amazing 🤩 and then some other person posted on the post saying he hated the taste and it was off, 

So I think just 1 or two batches of some cdt strains might of been off for just. A short time but everything I have gotten recently has been fine. This happened about 2 months ago for me though.

But yo tbh it could probably be cause ur used to the LR pod taste which honestly is nowhere near as good as the CDTs and 99.99% of the stiiizy users here will agree. 

LR from stiiizy is always burnt tasting and not very potent and not the best tasting from all my experiences with stiiizys LR pods, then I tried the CDTs and never ever went back cause they taste exactly like the strain since there strain derived CDTs and they are more potent also. I suggest trying a different flavor and hopefully it’ll be that sweet flavor like it should be.",2023年1

2877,"The general consensus is that LIVEST pods are better because they have the full terpene profile and they’re from one plant with no additives. This means that they’re better at providing a full body high and giving you that entourage effect. Technically all distillates provide the “same” high BUT for whatever reason in my experience most of the exotics have been better than the LIVEST pods. My favorite LIVEST pods would be Purple Wreck and Orange Creamsicle (don’t believe this is sold anymore though). I’ve tried most of the DNA’s and fire og was actually one of the only ones I got again, so I would definitely follow through with trying out that strain.",2023年1

2887,cdt?,2023年1
2888,Yeeeee Fax,2023年1
2889,Cannabis Derived Terpenes Pods. They’re the shiny silver ones.,2023年1
2890,Do those get you higher ? I feel like Live Resin are better than CDT,2023年1
2891,Its the other way around,2023年1
2892,Biiig bats burn solventless pods per stiiizy you’re not supposed to use them,2023年1
2893,Can you explain the differences in quality and feeling between the two?,2023年1
2894,"Only problem is that the oil in solventless burns way too easily with the stiiizy battery. Even if you follow the little instructions ( hitting it for 3 seconds. )

I thought the exact same thing as you my first time trying it.

I've now tried them at least over a dozen times and solventless is not worth it.

If anything. Cdt is the way to go. It's distilate so it won't burn super easy and it has the terps.

Solventless is trash until they fix the batteries.",2023年1
2895,Where does it say it on the packaging?,2023年1
2896,Why do some boxes have a barcode on the label of the strain and some don't?,2023年1
2897,bruh how tf? my big bat doesn’t even let me hit a solvent less pod on it,2023年1
2898,Because of taste/flavor or feeling?,2023年1
2899,"Know this is an old post, but in the same boat as you—dispo guy recommended me the solventless but neglected to tell me I shouldn’t use the big battery on it, and that’s all I have. Were you able to successfully smoke the whole pod w the big batt? If so did you do anything special to prevent it from burning up?",2023年6
2900,I don’t have the small battery and this solventless is all they had at the time.,2023年1
2901,"Solventless is clean in all the aspects, the extraction method is water, heat, pressure. So not only it’s pure but also a live extract. So it will have the entourage effect, meaning it will start as a slow building developing type of high which hits more as it settles in. Also since it is solventless there’s no bho or co2 as a byproduct. in simple words organic wax aka live rosin",2023年1
2902,"Then you got your regular bho, co2, ethanol extracts or crc extracts which are just refined and / or distilled extracts with a extra Chem thrown in to “purify” the oil from other byproduct but in it of itself it’s a solvent",2023年1
2903,They way It was explained to me is that there isn’t any additives put into it like butane and stuff and the high is more potent and last longer vs the the one on the right in the picture which is the opposite.,2023年1
2904,Above Stiiizy it says solventless.,2023年1
2905,v2 packaging doesn’t. newer v3 packaging has the barcode on the bottom strain sticker,2023年1
2906,"Why do people keep saying this. I put the pod on it, the light blinks and then I hit it lol",2023年1
2907,And it doesn’t have a burnt taste,2023年1
2908,Feeling last longer with the solventless,2023年1
2909,I had no issues that I noticed,2023年6
2910,Thats fine I’m just letting you know if you’re making the switch,2023年1
2911,"Stiiizy solventless is not clean, and most definitely not organic they use eagle 20(very toxic pesticide) dont be ignorant sir",2023年1
2912,Does their cdt line have the entourage effect as well?,2023年1
2913,Bro science,2023年1
2914,Oh okay. I was thinking about getting a stiiizy but i barely know anything about them or weed vapes in general,2023年1
2915,Thanks,2023年1
2916,"Tbh, idk if I should stick with solventless use live resin and r cdt or the regular pods. So many choices lol",2023年1
2917,Source?,2023年1
2918,You’re talking out your ass lmao I’d like to see what source you have that says stiiizy uses eagle 20,2023年1
2919,Yo I wasn’t talking about any brand in a specific way. Chill foo damn plus that’s why ion fw stizzy they shi always seems low tier regardless,2023年1
2920,"I haven’t tried them in a while but I recall having diamond og, wifi 43, white fire, and a couple others but those I remember those better way better lr is coo but not worth the price Atleast form stiiizy, but the cdt are fair because there’s more strain selections and now there’s better drops I’ve been dwelling on gettin one but I’m coo with what I just picked up, but yes cdt does have a entourage effect still gon have the disti type kick overall but just not as bad more like a pleasant distillate extract",2023年1
2921,I know it sounds like a jumbled mess lol,2023年1
2922,"I don’t know a lot but make sure if you go want to get into it, go to a legit dispensary. Got one a few months back and scratched off the code and scanned it. Pod was scanned like 980 times.",2023年1
2923,👍🏼 it’s made cleaner as well,2023年1
2924,"CDT is the best ! I use it with the biig battery, once you try them you never go back to the regular pod",2023年1
2925,Does the biig battery burn hotter?,2023年1
2926,"You can use the biig battery with the CDT pod , it won’t burn the oil like the solventless pods.",2023年1
2927,This is a dumb question but why does the biig battery burn the solventless,2023年1
2928,"Stiiizy Big Batteries will run too hot for the solventless pod, so they recommend regular battery to maintain the taste of the terpenes.",2023年1
2929,"Gotch ya, now I understand. All i got is the biig battery though.",2023年1
2930,Then take like 1-2 sec hits max and not back to back,2023年1
2931,Did you scan the QR code?,2023年1
2932,"Battery looks just like mine, bought from Stiiizy. Pod looks lil off tho idk. I buy my stiiizy all over though.",2023年1
2933,"If it’s more than one time, I’d call or go see the place you bought it from.",2023年1
2934,Ya pods aka carts sometimes not legit.,2023年1
2935,Yea it said it was scanned but 1 time already ? Unless I was that 1 time and I'm tripping but.. I have had that happened to me couple times.,2023年1
2936,Same I vary from where I get pods from but this one was from a dp in cali,2023年1
2937,"Maybe some pods QR codes are of the same batch, I’m not sure though.",2023年1
2938,You good bro it happens when you scan it once the rule is if it’s been scanned less than 5 times) it’s good anything over a few hundred or thousand are fakes,2023年4
2939,If u took a picture of the bottom of the pod i’d be able to tell if it’s fake or not,2023年1
2940,"Maybe, hopefully next time it doesn't happen. Thanks for the help!",2023年1
2941,And also theres times where i thought i didn’t scan my code but i did so then it registered twice so it was on my behalf . maybe that’s what u done ?,2023年1
2942,I just scanned mine I got 2 days ago and it went from 1 scan to 3 and I get mine from a legit dispensary so idk what’s going on lol,2023年1
2943,"one time I posted my stiiizy on fake carts Reddit along w the verification link for 1st scan, like 4 hours later it was up to 60 scans somehow. I was convinced it was fake but I took down the post to see if that was cause of the scans,  not one more person scanned the code after I took down the Reddit post. definitely weird asf idk why that many randoms would take the time to scan the code from my post. I’ve gotten like 3 stiiizy from same place since then and all have scanned authentic w no more scans after",2023年2
2944,liiil stiiizys (and other un-chargeable disposables) tend to die before you finish all the wax. I would recommend just buying a regular battery and pod,2023年1
2945,"Having experience with e cig batteries for over a decade now, I thought disposable thc devices without charging are the dumbest thing ever. 

With prolonged hits of thick oil the battery will not last at all in comparison to quick hits from a nicotine disposable. 

This was a terrible idea. Honestly it is marketed towards being discreet, not primary use.",2023年1
2946,"If you didn’t get it from the dispo, fs fake. If you got it from a dispo, go back and let them know what’s up you’ll most likely get a replacement or refund.",2023年1
2947,I don’t fuck with stiizy for this reason. Cause it happens on all of their products. I started using lime disposable pens and they last twice as long.,2023年1
2948,"if it ever stops working, i had a friend say she would open the disposable n use the rest for her dab",2023年1
2949,I may just be dumb and it’s dead but I would think they would be good for more then a week with mild use,2023年1
2950,The lil stiiizy is the real reason why I stopped fw them,2023年1
2951,try a different brand:),2023年1
2952,"Must be luck of the draw, my two disposables have lasted me a few months with normal use. Granted I don't smoke that much, mostly a hit or 2 a day, if that",2023年1
2953,"Unfortunately that is not the case with these shiddy half gram non rechargeable’s, lesson learned ✅",2023年1
2954,You can open it up and charge it by touching the positive and negative to a usb cord that’s spliced open but you need to know what your doing and have basic electrical skills. It can be dangerous if done wrong or carelessly.,2023年1
2955,"No, they’re halfway full :)",2023年1
2956,Stand them up 😂,2023年1
2957,Stand them up straight,2023年1
2958,that’s what happens when you smoke them,2023年1
2959,Looks about right,2023年1
2960,"Keeping them upright, will help preserve the pod, and also can cause the pod to get clogged when on its side, the bubbles also rise to the top so then you can really tell how full they are, from the looks one seems about 1/4 left, and the other about 1/2 full.",2023年1
2961,thanks yall for the info!!,2023年1
2962,they are both fully toxic:),2023年1
2963,"I believe I have found the problem as to why this whole wax coming out the top of the pods lately has been happening right as most of us have been turning our Heaters back on in our cars and our workplaces and offices, homes, etc. 

I personally can guarantee that this was the cause of my stiiizy pods wax coming up the top, it was never a problem ever and then once it’s been fuck in ice cold with this rain and the heater in the car and hot air the pod is always exposed to now isn’t normal and it’s starting to cause this to happen more and more. 

I fixed it by keeping my shit in a very cool dark drawer and away from the heat outlets in my room which it used to sit almost directly under.. 

Same with the pod that leaked up the top in my car, I left it in there in the Heat and was hitting the pen in that hOt ass 90 degree+ max best air chilling in ur whip just murders the pods it seems. Ever since I have now stopped blasting the heater and been more aware of moving that shit away from the heat I haven’t had the wax coming up the top anymore at all!",2023年1
2964,yeah mine gets clogged up like that all the time once i start using up a pod. i use something like the end of an old incense stick (non burnt side) and just stick it down the mouth hole and clear out the wax like that and it works like a charm. you kind of have to keep doing that though.,2023年1
2965,"use a toothpick to clear it and when you arent using your pen leave it standing upright so wax doesnt clog the top, thats the best way i was able to keep it from doing it as much. also when you do have to clear it like that, take a slow pull to heat it up instead of a fast strong one and it wont shoot out like that",2023年1
2966,"Every single pod I've gotten the last few months has done this, it's so frustrating!!! I keep it upright and out of major heat and cold and don't take ridiculously long hits or anything to make sure this doesn't happen and my almost full gram pod basically spilt itself out the top of the pod over the course of 2 weeks and is now empty (wasn't hitting it that often either)",2023年1
2967,Hit it for half a sec on the battery then pull it off and hit it until it clears up. May take one or two tries.,2023年1
2968,"Ummm I’ve used a fuckton of carts and drain them till they’re incredibly dead, and no that’s never happened",2023年1
2969,I always keep mine in a drawer where it’s room temperature and never had this problem. You could be right,2023年1
2970,this is my exact situation rn 😭,2023年1
2971,SAME LIKE WHY,2023年1
2972,"Yea bro and this was never a problem ever before but then once Winter came around and got cold (thus everyone cranks their heaters no matter where u may be) I have been seeing many posts of the wax coming up which I never used to see that often at all, so yea I know this at least completely fixed the problem for me so hopefully it can help others also.",2023年1
2973,It's probably shorted and putting the battery into current protection mode. Pull the bottom cap off and look at the contact for hair sized wires sticking out of the contacts. Cut them off.,2023年1
2974,"Just take a eyeglass screwdriver or a razor blade and push up the 2 copper pins in the bottom. Put the screwdriver next to the pin and pry up, don’t push down. The battery’s pins aren’t connecting to the pods pins",2023年1
2975,"The part that senses the cart and heats it could be dirty, try taking a slightly iso dipped swab and wipe the two metal things in the battery then dry with the other side thats my guess,,",2023年1
2976,Mine is doing the same thing.,2023年2
2977,I get Live resin stiiizy pods all the time and i highly doubt people are able to Fake those type of oils,2023年1
2978,Also stiiizy has been having problems with QR codes apparently,2023年1
2979,Where did you find bull stiizy’s?,2023年1

2982,no sourcing,2023年1
2983,"that is normal and is what mine looks like
sometimes",2023年1
2984,Nah you burnt your coil. Or it’s just discoloration from oxidation 🤷‍♂️,2023年1
2985,Thank you for your responses,2023年1
2986,Ok yea sometimes it is oxidization but sometimes it means that your pod or the place where you put in the pod got dirty if it tastes off and fucks up your lungs and breathing throw it away,2023年1
2987,throw it away,2023年1
2988,Normal. Happens with use,2023年1
2989,Its the big battery it burns at a higher voltage and hits harder. Sometimes when you take a hit the oil goes back from the wick. And you can see it got burnt from the coil. Thats the discoloration. You can also try the original small stiiizy battery and see if it doesnt burn it. The big rips tho and its been my most reliable stiiizy battery.,2023年1
2990,could be oxidation or you burnt a bit of your cotton in your pod which is known to produce this same look,2023年1
2991,why does it have a sticker,2023年1
2992,"thats absolutely disgusting, but happens when you get dog water hardware... not to mention the dog water oil in it...",2023年1

3001,no. just use super glue on the black plastic part that’s sticking out then push it up and let it dry n then it’s brand new.,2023年1

Once u try these CDTs u will never buy the normal BDT pods or the LR ones or the Solventless ones!! These are he best stiiizy makes when it comes to potency and amazing strain specific tastes. 

And best part is they are only 2 dollars extra for these rather then the normal line! And 8 bucks cheaper then the LRs! Please try as many as u can cause the flavors and the highs are the fuckin best

3183,"Yeah bro, their magnet detection is lowk ass and the big stiizy can run into a lot of issues just like the electronics coming out the bottom. But as far as their quality of oil and if you get lucky and find a nice functioning battery, you'll be set right.",2023年1
3184,"Yeah the pods are way overpriced and we all know that we somewhat “pay for the brand” because it’s expected to be the highest quality.

3209,"THIS!!!! it’s been almost a year since i quit stiiizy but i worked there for over a year at multiple locations and everything you said happened at my stores too. it’s genuinely the worst dispensary chain to work for. on top of the constant surveillance by management, micromanaging, excessive changing of SOP, and general inconsistencies by MGMT, you don’t even receive any of the same perks budtenders at other dispensaries do. all you receive in the quarterly “goody bags” are expired product and shit no one wants, while other budtenders get goody bags biweekly with FRESH product that is actually safe to consume. these other budtenders also get opportunities to do budtender training in order to receive free product from popular brands, or opportunities to attend huge cannabis networking events like hall of flowers and emerald cup, but stiiizy doesn’t want their budtenders to have those experiences like other dispos do. also the fact that they stay open 365 days a year and don’t even alter their hours on major holidays on top of this THC % inflation lawsuit just screams capitalistic greed. the fact that they fired budtenders that walked out of a 100F degree store bc they’re too lazy to call someone to replace the A/Cs is proof enough they have zero integrity for their product, employees, and customers. they don’t even know how to take care of their inventory. my store had a broken concentrates fridge for MONTHS before upper mgmt decided it was time to fix it. that means people were buying deteriorated solventless products, like expensive top shelf shit that’s $80-$90+ per gram. they would keep so many eighths of flower in the LED cases and then would try to make us sell bleached ass flower that no one wants 😭 literally zero integrity. it’s FUCK STIIIZY forever. the dispensaries’ upper management is ran by former high school teachers, it’s why working for them makes you feel like you’re back in the 5th grade again. even being in elementary school i had more liberation than working for STIIIZY. i don’t understand how they think they can have successful stores when literally 95% of their staff leaves every 6 months",2022年12

3211,Do any of you know what the demo unit from stiiizy is?,2022年12
3212,"YES YES AND YES. they will fire you within your first three months so that you don't secure a union position. you're not union until that probationary period ends. i literally watch as they mislead customers every day and i can't do anything to help. btw, if you return something they've made an ""exception"" for - you get banned from the store for violating return policy. even when it's their fault. Ive seen my store manager ban a customer for returning a 7g bag that weighed in at 5g since that technically violated the policy. Foul asf. The fact their turnover rate is roughly 73% should tell you enough.",2022年12

3290,I’m sorry I don’t think I understand you’re question but to the best of my understanding this is what you asked. “How come stiiizy live resin pods taste like just bud compared to the stiiizy flavored distillate pods” it’s simply just terps when it comes down to it. One has added terps for strain specific flavors when the other has the taste of weed through the whole process. I hope this is able to help you,2023年1

Unless you smoke a lot to where your palette can distinguish the tastes between live rosins then no, I literally cop “bubblegum gelato” and “lava cake” live rosin pods and it tastes the exact same to me.

3314,It’s almost as if you just saw the headline of the law suit and didn’t read into it at all what you are doing is speculating not based of any evidence just speculation you asked if they are unsafe due to this lawsuit the answer is no this lawsuit only involves their thc pre rolls and doesn’t have anything to do with pesticides and safety,2022年12

3316,Where in the bay?,2023年1
3317,Just because the law suit is about pre rolls doesn’t mean that they couldn’t have tampered with past or current lab tests for other products. Potency and pesticides are tested by the same laboratory and on the same report.,2022年12
3318,bruh again I ask you how come this third party lab test of the pre roll found nothing wrong with the pesticides? smh you asked if it’s a safety issue the answer is no you are just looking for reasons to distrust stiiizy and that’s fine but stick with a legitimate reason all what you are doing is speculation only the pre rolls were found to be at fault and only the thc percentage not pesticides,2022年12

3365,"I must have gone through some 5 dozen pods and not one of them has ever leaked. Either you are doing something wrong, or I need to play the lottery.

For those of you with leaking pods. Where do you live. STIIIZY just became available here in Michigan a year or so ago. Perhaps the pods here are made in a different facility than in other states. The equipment to make them here will be new and maybe a different, upgraded model from that in other states. Maybe that is resulting in a more consistent and trouble free product.",2022年12
3366,Yes I’ve been having this issue for about two months now and it’s extremely frustrating. I’m considering a different brand entirely. I’m pretty sure they switched manufacturers this year because I’ve been smoking them for years and never had this issue until  November-December 2022,2022年12

I just smoke the CDT carts they’re the best they make. And there live resin edibles are fuckin slappers too. But yea the news about them was only because they added 10~15% thc to whatever the prerolls had.. so the label that would say “92% thc” would mean it was really just 80% instead.. but again who the fuck buys prerolls lmfaoo. Everything else is legit from em ur good g enjoy,2022年12

3481,There’s no lab tests on this box. Very fishy even for Michigan. Everyone I’ve ever bought has lab tests on the back or bottom of the box itself,2022年12
3482,Why don't you scratch the QR?,2022年12
3483,$35 valid for the .5g?,2022年12
3484,Prob gonna get a 1g $60 plus bat idk the price of bat yet,2022年12
3485,"only inf your hitting blinkers n shit, my old one ran out and the battery never died",2022年12
3486,"The testing label is always found on the bottom of the box, at least in Michigan, it’s just not pictured here. The Liiil is genuine.",2022年12
3487,"Not my pics, ill prob get a 1g pod and battery instead of dispo",2022年12
3488,I’d definitely get a pod n a battery over the disposable. stiiizy disposables can die early leaving a bunch of wax still in there,2022年12
3489,Oh I see. Just a question you posted this as a picture obviously right? For some reason I can't post pics to r/stiiizy it says it's not allowed.,2022年12
3490,"Oh shi alr, what’s a good price for a bat",2022年12
3491,Hm that’s weird I tried a vid and that didn’t work so I did pics,2022年12
3492,"all posts are removed by the automod n have to be manually approved. reason is there’s a lot of sourcing n selling posts that don’t need to go up. I try to be pretty active, at least once a day approving posts. yours is up now",2022年12
3493,$20. I’d try to get a deal if you buy both. $60 for the pod alone is pretty steep depending where you are,2022年12
3494,"might be something on your end. someone else was able to post a video here

3495,Closest place is 5 or 6-7 hours away so paying for convenience,2022年12
3496,"It looks so much better than an empty pod, that's for sure.

Enjoy",2022年12
3497,I just got a couple of .5s today and they are recently produced I swear they are so much clearer than the older ones I recently just had. Great flavors too I’m happy,2022年12
3498,It's like the monolith from 2001 A Space Odyssey,2022年12
3499,"Wow, the box looks just like a real stizzy box. It’s fake tho since it’s been verified 50,000",2022年12
3500,Wow the fakes are getting good thank god stiiizy just changed the packaging again,2022年12
3501,They took few hits of the pods before you got it lol 😭,2022年12
3502,"while it’s a good looking fake, it’s still fake. 50k previous verifications is a giveaway",2022年12
3503,already took off the rubber at the bottom at the start btw,2022年12
3504,"50,007 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭",2022年12
3505,Color off as hell . And the leaves don’t even look right . Plus if it says more than you scanned it for the first time fake.,2022年12
3506,Sorry but yes you did with that many verifies,2022年12
3507,"Stopped buying stizzys a long time ago, even when I’ve bought from legit shops, I’m still questioning if it’s real. There was a time that CA sticker on the pod we’re 2 different sizes, I don’t trust them at all",2022年12
3508,Did u smoke it?,2022年12
3509,I was gonna say it looks like shit I’ve bought before. Stickers and everything. Evil,2022年12
3510,atp it could've been up somebody's butt before i got it,2022年12
3511,my friend tries to claim he got it from off the charts dispo,2022年12
3512,it's such a weird number and it keeps going up too,2022年12
3513,hell no,2022年12
3514,"Doesn’t matter where he got it at at this point. It’s been scanned 50,000 times previously. This fake I will say looks wayyyyy better than alot of of the stiiizy fakes we see on the sub, but that’s all u can give props for. Other than that stay away and find new source cuz these ain’t real!",2022年12
3515,"Well, this isn’t useful information as the scan count already tells you the packaging is fake and not from a licensed dispensary but Off the Charts only stocks the liiil stiiizy disposables and not the 1g pods so add another data point to the already settled pile haha",2022年12
3516,"There’s no way your friend got that from a dispo. The placement is off on a lot of things plus no testing dude. Cuz that, that label is fake af. Don’t knock stiiizy cuz of this. Knock whoever sold you that shit. And lesson learned brotha.",2022年12
3517,"Bro what if all these fake stiiizy are linked to one specific serial number which is why the number is 50,000 but directs you to a authentication link idk just a thought bro",2022年12
3518,off the charts has  multiple different locations and they definitely sell 1g stiiizys. you’re probably looking at a live menu,2022年12
3519,yeah probably mass bulk production of fakes,2022年12
3520,"Ah yeah could be, I checked all locations but it is live menu - either way they ain’t selling boxes with 50k scans 😂",2022年12
3521,"yea I agree, OP’s friend is definitely capping or trynna pull a fast one on em",2022年12
3522,"Hope this is allowed, I just wanted to share these skins I made for the biiig battery, you can get em from my Etsy store!

3538,... Silly question.. Og kush,2023年5
3539,[deleted],2022年12

3544,"use tweaker wires, if the pod burns and you can hit it it's an issue with your battery.",2022年12
3545,Suck really hard,2022年12
3546,Suck on that hoe bro sounds sus but don’t knock till you try then hit it for like 2-3 secs to heat up the wax so that it unclogs then dry hot again you should be good if not repeat it’s happend to me before to 💯,2022年12
3547,Try covering the bottom vent and inhaling hard,2022年12
3548,"Thank you ! I did! It wasn't working at first and now I can dry pull but it won't even let me hit it at all still the bottom of my pen turns half red half white on the battery , I'm thinking of blow drying it",2022年12
3549,I am down plz teach me hiw,2022年12
3550,Do you pop the top of the pods and just get something to scoop it out ?,2022年12
3551,yeah srs my 45 mins of time is worth more than 2 toasty sessions,2022年12
3552,Ok thank you!,2022年12
3553,How,2022年12
3554,Pop the top and get a metal tipped syringe,2022年12
3555,"Def YouTube it, but wrap a tshirt or rubber band around the top and use some pliers to wiggle it. If you try and use your fingers you’ll be trying all night. Bueno suerte!",2022年12
3556,Yeah most spots are serious about that 7 day rule. Always gotta put the carts to work before those 7 days pass,2022年12
3557,Appreciate you!,2022年12
3558,Fuck lesson learned :( but fuck them fr,2022年12
3559,What I don't get is what if I just buy more And say it was that cart ?,2022年12
3560,"I’m not sure but you can also go and give it a shot, you might get a nice employee who will let you slide. You can also try and take the top off and transfer the oil to an empty cart",2022年12
3561,"Yeah I think I'm going to try that out I'm just not exactly sure how to do it, gonna google , any tips?",2022年12
3562,what did u think of the live resin diamonds?,2022年12
3563,🔥,2022年12
3564,i only took one hit of it out of my e rig and was faded den a hoe bruh 8/10 on taste🤟🏿,2022年12
3565,"Stiiizy dropped the ball with the solventless pods. Their battery’s burn at too many voltages, with no way to adjust it. Even stiiizy themselves gave tips like “don’t hit too long, give ample time between hits, etc”

Honestly that’s what threw me off of smoking stiiizy 🤷🏽",2022年12
3566,"yeah bro just recently purchased one and it tastes like coil half full. i’ve noticed a down trend in stiiizy quality control in general tho recently, most things don’t really seem like what they used to.",2022年12
3567,A year or two ago I had really bad luck with strawnana pods.  3 out of 4 tasted like straight burnt plastic.,2022年12
3568,Yeah their solventless pods burn so fucking easily unfortunately. Which is why it only comes out in half grams as well I believe,2022年12
3569,the special editions like the cdt or the live resin or solventless stiizys are more prone to coming with manufacturing issues like burnt coil when it comes. i’ve had stiizys come and they taste like empty when they’re full… just an issue. some dispensaries might allow you to exchange product,2022年12
3570,"Yeah, bought one last week and got maybe 4 hits before it burned. Light rips too. Same battery and everything. Bummer cause they’re usually fire, but I won’t grab one again because of it",2022年12
3571,I only bougt the solventless once. Just seemed like a half gram of live resin to me.,2022年12
3572,Be sure not to use the BIIIG battery with the solventless pods. It will most definitely burn your solventless. It's written on the website.,2022年12
3573,"Worst part for me is this one is brand brand new, barely hit it like 6 times, so it would fall within the window to go get a new one, but I had already thrown out all the trash n shit just cuz how much confidence I have in stiiizy",2022年12
3574,"No yea, lil battery only and that shit started tasting like this a few hits in",2022年12
3575,The plastic doesn’t look right on the mouthpiece the real ones have more texture.,2022年12
3576,[deleted],2022年12
3577,"you’re good, that’s been an issue recently with stiiizys verification system. lots of posts on here of ppl buying from licensed dispos/delivery services and having the same issue",2022年12
3578,If it says invalid and not already been scanned then you’re good,2022年12
3579,"oops, my original comment never posted. 

n clean carts is a terrible sub. they believe if you didn’t walk into a licensed dispo yourself and buy it, there’s no possible way it can be real. a silly mindset. and that mod loves to deliberately spread misinformation even when corrected. the fakecartridges sub is without a doubt the better of the two",2022年12
3580,Sativa 👍🏽,2022年12
3581,Orange sunsets a ideal strain for daytime,2022年12
3582,"All the BDT strains feels the same since it’s just pure THC, there’s no cannabis terpenes .",2022年12
3583,ok... any particular strains? Or are most sativas more or less the same effect?,2022年12
3584,Second this just got it and 2 hits feels like i shotgunned a monster. Very alert and energetic.,2022年12
3585,a nice recommendation i have is orange cream,2022年12
3586,I’d also go with orange sunset. Great head high,2022年12
3587,I like the Skywalker OG. I think that's one of the most potent pods they got.,2022年12
3588,Space cake solventless pod is my go to for creativity,2022年12
3589,skywalker OG / OG kush are the best pods,2022年12
3590,It really good I like it,2022年12
3591,these are my two favorite original strains from them. love the taste on both,2022年12
3592,None 💀. My small batt still cloggs n burns tha shit,2022年12
3593,I believe it's not recommended to use the solventless with the biiig. the rest should be fine,2022年12
3594,Bro is sucking these pods at 99 psi,2022年12
3595,"Quit trying to suck the soul out of your stiiizy, I know you said you take light drags but the evidence says otherwise. I have never had that happen to a stiiizy, but I had a heavy hitters cart that happened to, the airway was clogged and I sucked too hard to clear and that was the result",2022年12
3596,"Out of curiosity, how hard do you hit the pen? Do you do blinker hits?",2022年12
3597,LIKE WTF WHAT IF I BUY MORE AND JUST SAY IT WAS FROM THAT PURCHASE LIKE WTF MAKES ME FKN SENSE,2022年12
3598,I never had my stiizy leak before,2022年12
3599,"Usually before leaking you should notice the vape is clogged when you try to hit it. If that’s the case don’t pull hard to try to unclogged it, insert a needle through the hole in the mouthpiece.",2022年12
3600,Keep your battery fully charged it should always be on white and keep the pod upright. Those 2 things will definitely keep it from getting as clogged.,2022年12
3601,"Thanks for sharing, your situation is identical to mine. It's been frustrating and a waste of money, since it's happened to several pods, and I'm outside the return window. 

I also apreciate people in the comments giving suggestions but it's hard for me to believe that after all the pods I've gone through (and had zero problems) that it's now something I'm doing, like hitting it too hard or not storing upright.  

I think it's a manufacturing or quality issue and I really hope it's acknowledged and resolved.",2022年12
3602,THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOOOO,2022年12
3603,AND THEY TOLD ME THE SAME SHIT,2022年12
3604,No I usually take like 5 sec hits with a light drag,2022年12
3605,I buy 6 at a time and literally 3 did it last time I just bought 4 hopefully they don’t do it,2022年12
3606,"That's odd, yeah usually at my shop it's people taking blinker hits on the biiig battery that makes this happen, but I don't know why it would be doing this in your case.",2022年12
3607,Let me know :( which ones do you get,2022年12
3608,that’s been an issue recently with stiiizys verification system. lots of posts on this sub abt it,2022年12

3620,Yeah I eventually gave up trying to find a fix cause I definitely think the batteries defective which sucks cause I can’t even get a refund but whatever,2022年12
3621,I hope you’re able to fix yours though,2022年12
3622,having the same problem - i’m in ga and get stuff shipped - so getting another one isn’t really an option - any help would be awesome - thanks.,2023年1

3657,"I’ve had two recent cartridges do that. I was able to take them back and get them exchanged. However, it is annoying AF and I did burn my lip. When I’m outside and it is cold, I blow gently into the cartridge a few time so it warms up. Then I take hits slowly. So far it has been working fine. I think it is a temperature thing. Too cold makes the liquid firm up and you have to work harder causing an overheating issue.",2022年12
3658,Yeah maybe it’s fake or are you at high elevation? It could be pressure pushing it out.,2022年12
3659,Mine does this occasionally. I have to really work to get it out and it turned me off stizzy because that shit tastes awful. Sometimes I would have to warm up the cart to stop this from happening.,2022年12

3661,[removed],2022年12
3662,I hate when that happens. I don’t think it’s fake though. My guess is that it happens if you hit it too much at once,2022年12
3663,it’s so annoying to prevent it i’ve tried to keep it up right ! it helps,2022年12
3664,leaving it in the car for even 20 min on a hot day,2022年12
3665,i think you sucking on it too hard homie. try just pulling hard enough to turn the light on. you will get better clouds and tastier hits that way too,2022年12
3666,"take that shit back bro, that’s not normal.",2022年12
3667,damn that’s a blinker gone at least,2022年12
3668,most likely its because of how many times you repeatedly hit it and/or it overheated,2022年12
3669,Thank you boss Imma try that but also I do think they may have a issue with manufacturing and QC of the pods themselves,2022年12
3670,"It most def is a temperature thing. They do firm up in the cold. You can also put it under your armpit for a few seconds, let it warm up, and it should be good to go without pulling too hard.

They will go through your entire bag if they need to for any reason especially if you’re coming from out of the country. Also nicotine vapes are illegal in many parts of Mexico includes juuls. Security ain’t dumb,2022年12
3676,I’ve taken my stiiizy on a lot of trips. Rub off any logo. What keeps them from finding it is keeping the pod and the battery in separate bags. Don’t give them a reason to look through ur bag. If u finish a pod on the trip just throw it away. The battery by itself doesn’t look like anything sus,2022年12

3680,I took one to mazatlan so yeah yr good,2023年1
3681,it is a new one j arrived yesterday. would that work?,2022年12
3682,I’m going to Mexico next week from LAX to Mexico City so on my backpack would be cool if I put my stiizy pods i have a little pocket to put them would that be good?,2022年12

3687,"Always keep it standing, not sure why it clogs lol.",2022年12
3688,I’ve been doing this lately and it works sometimes,2022年12
3689,I’ve done most of this already but to your point I think some pods just clog just because. I notice some pods do it more than others so it could also just be an issue for when they make the pods idk lol. Appreciate the tips though thank you!,2022年12
3690,"This used to be a problem with mine, I just think really it’s about the way you pull, I used to take huge ass hits and the little thing would even come out sometimes as well, I stopped the habit and the clogging happened less",2022年12

3692,I’m gonna try the taking small hits thing forsure. Might be my issue lol.,2022年12
3693,I’ve noticed the .5 don’t clog as much as the full gram ones do. My current one is a full gram live resin and it clogs at least once a day if not twice lol.,2022年12
3694,Lmk how it goes :),2022年12
3695,Flip it around and push down when you hit it. Or battery faulty,2022年12
3696,One of the reasons I gave up on stiizys this was a problem for me with 3 different batteries two new ones. They’re junk.,2022年12
3697,This has happened to me multiple times. I’ve spent so much money trying to combat this and I’m done spending money on their shit that always does this even though it’s brand new.,2022年12

Don’t smoke live resin or solventless with the big battery because it burns it ridiculously fast and burns a lot of the terpenes you’re after while also usually tasting clearly burnt. I’d highly recommend stocking up on cdt and distillate if that’s you’re thing with the biiig battery but imo, the regular is better to have.",2022年12

3711,They don’t care about legal cannabis. For batteries just put them in your carry on like they ask.,2022年12
3712,I took mine through today. They specifically said they don’t want batteries in the checked bags but vapes and other devices are ok in carry ons. I didn’t keep my pods and my batteries together though. They were in the same bag for care on but separated in different pockets just in case tsa noticed.,2022年12
3713,Yup. I’ve flown with it a couple times. I carry a battery and a couple gram carts. Separate them in my carry on and if asked I’ll say it’s a Juul clone. Its legal where I fly out of so I assume it’s not worth it as long as I’m not hauling a shit ton.,2022年12
3714,Just don’t fly to Russia with it lol,2023年1
3715,it worked? how many pods did you take,2023年6
3716,Just one a .5g cart.,2023年6

3722,Bruh don’t tell me that lol damnit,2022年12
3723,this was my experience with the new ice cream cake flavor. first stiiizy i ever had in 3 years that clogged up so bad and the oil leaked. it bubbled everytime i used it,2022年12

3731,Hell yea bro 😎 💯,2022年12

3733,Lmao 😂,2022年12

3737,If you did not buy from a legit store it could be fake. Some code are not working and your product could be legit,2022年12
3738,Thank you so much i appreciate your knowledge,2022年12
3739,Saved my high ass a lot of time 💪🏼,2022年12
3740,The new hardware is trash imo,2022年12
3741,"What is the hardware difference? cannabis, derived terpene Stiiizy pod, but it said invalid serial number.",2023年1
3742,Stop spreading false info. Do your research. There has been multiple occasions where the pods have not scanned properly due to issues with the serial code. Nothing to do with the legitimacy of the oil in the pod it’s a technical error. I just like to check sometimes !,2022年12
3743,"Don’t listen to that dude , he clearly don’t know what he is speaking about . I literally had the same thing happen to me today . Got a .5 
fcdt off Weedmaps from a legit dispo (7points) and it says invalid . Everything checks out perfectly",2022年12
3744,could be clogged or a dud. the disposables are notorious for dying early. id take it back and try to exchange it,2022年12
3745,Return it immediately that happened to me twice before only with the disposable ones I recommend you take a hit right after you leave the dispensary to make sure they hit,2022年12
3746,My 1 gram disposable hit for 2 days then it got clogged and I charged it and inhaled and you can hear it melting and passing through but my problem was that now it’s burning hot and the wax also came out onto my teeth and tongue and shit burned also got a deep high on it .. it’s kinda scary I don’t like my tongue burning up nor swallowing the wax,2023年2
3747,doesnt feel clogged. ive tried ripping it for 5 straight minutes and nothin. you thing the dispo will take it back or replace it?,2022年12
3748,Yes. If its an factory defect. They supposed to replace it. U paid.,2022年12
3749,"depends, they should. if it’s a dud from the start they should. normally dispos only take back faulty product so this should fall along the lines of that",2022年12
3750,At my store (stiiizy) you're allowed to bring it back with at least half of the product in there and get a replacement.,2022年12
3751,Yeah I was told the same. Only half grams at the moment. But then I was told that you had to buy one of those new eighth herb packs in order to buy this new pod. Don’t know if the tender was trying to swindle me… but I ended up not getting it. I usually just purchase full gram pods.,2022年12
3752, https://offerup.co/6v44dte6xvb,2022年12
3753,"Only half’s rn and not all dispos have it. If you’re located in LA or OC, Kushagram has them at 20!",2022年12
3754,"different dispos have different requirements, the one I went to luckily didnt have any. you could buy as much as you want as long as it was under the legal limit.",2022年12
3755,I believe it's only in halfs rn so that they can distribute more until it's in full production. The pineapple runtz is suppose to be an exclusive drop for new locations so they had that deal to buy bud then get a cartridge for 1$,2022年12
3756,Yeah I went to another one and they had it for sale. Shits fire I wish they had a full gram,2022年12
3757,Ahh I see 💯,2022年12
3758,"Weird my experience is its Great. Pods clog maybe once every 3 months, no scalding hot oil either. And it gets me fucked up. Bay area",2022年12
3759,"We switched to Heavy Hitters and haven't looked back since. Stiiizy's quality, in my opinion, has decreased significantly over the past year or so. And at $50/gram, it's just not worth it anymore",2022年12

3761,"Stiiizy’s pods and battery are great, but it’s severely overpriced. Definitely not buying from them again once I finish my current pods.",2022年12
3762,Put the pen down.,2022年12
3763,Hit it for a sec on the battery then pull it off and fully hit it to open the air holes. Maybe you bought fake pods if they don’t scan. I have been using them for a while now and it’s mostly a pleasant experience.,2022年12
3764,If your using the regular battery they suck and have a lot of issues. I had 2 and both didn’t work. Bought 2 big batteries and both worth flawless and never any spit back or clogging.,2022年12
3765,Take the pod out. Unclog it. and then put it in and hit it. Its cuz your hitting it way to hard. Fein ass foos. No wonder my shit always clogged. Dumbass ppl like u,2022年12
3766,Same experience. Clogged and leaking 1g live resin pods after like 3 hits. Complete waste of money - if I don't get good customer service then fuck this product,2022年12
3767,Idk where youre paying 50 a gram for stiiizy pods but you gotta go elsewhere,2022年12
3768,It's not a disposable. But its looking like I'm gonna have to throw it away anyhow.,2022年12
3769,Try a plug n play they 75$,2022年12
3770,I bought it from a real ass dispo. I see no reason why it would be fake,2022年12
3771,"Damn since you such an expert on tip sucking, How bout you unclog this dick?!",2022年12
3772,The price and lack of availability for Plugplay isn’t preferable. I’ll probably just switch to West Coast Cure (or any of the verified brands at my local licensed dispensary),2022年12
3773,Yo mama bitch,2022年12
3774,"God they’re falling apart, verification has been spotty for months and now outright outages really undermines the value of their once industry leading verification system",2022年12
3775,"Common mistake on their end. This happened around the same time last year , it’s nothing new don’t worry.",2022年12
3776,Did you get it from a Stiiizy store or a dispensary personally?,2022年12
3777,"Me too, u can type in the numbers manually tho",2022年12
3778,For me when i went to took the photo it would load but when i manually typed in verify.stiiizy and it worked for me,2022年12
3779,where?,2022年12
3780,"you’re trippin, that’s normal lol",2022年12
3781,its normal they have more play because of how much taller they are,2022年12
3782,that’s normal homie you’re all good 🤞🏽,2022年12
3783,i was bothered by that once too so i completely get where you're coming from but it's fine & normal you're chillin,2022年12
3784,I like the pods in the car lol,2022年12
3785,It’s just couse it’s big for the little bat,2022年12
3786,"Gotta take a T break. Thats why I stopped smoking carts, they’re good when your tolerance is low, but once it skyrockets, you’re just wasting 40-60$ every 3-5 days for a weak 1 hour high. Take a break for at least a week and you will the results. Also, try smoking plant more.",2022年11
3787,I would consider not hitting throughout the day. I wait till the late evening and take my hits then. I still get very high once I hit the slump stage. I knock out and rinse and repeat,2022年11
3788,"You need to be careful with carts, they can jack up your tolerance. I’ve had carts send me to space (with tolerance built) with 2-4 hits.

Haven’t smoked in 48 hours though, and my tolerance drops fast (and my tolerance is naturally low, something about my body chemistry). I guarantee a 4-6 second hit fully held right now, will send me to space.

Space your hits, ride out nice highs. Don’t get focused on getting blasted. If you can wait, then wait.",2022年11
3789,Could just have a high tolerance.  Try some edibles where you know how many mg generally you are getting.,2022年12
3790,I wait until the withdrawal starts kicking in,2022年12
3791,Do blinker hits,2022年11
3792,Same problem. Bought a battery and solventless pod from stiiizy store And never really hit quite like the first 5 or so puffs. Battery life sucks too,2022年11
3793,I'll have the same thing after a day or two then I hear a pop and the smoke billows out.  I'm assuming an air bubble or something nefarious preventing me from a good deep hit.  But alas I perceiver though my trials and tribulations for my Stiiizy Zen.,2022年11
3794,"It's getting plugged up. To avoid that burnt taste, try blowing through it first. If it's plugged, you should hear a little pop and then it will hit. If it's not hitting after you blow through it, then hit it really light, just enough to light the light. That will soften the wax. After hitting it lightly for 2 seconds or so, quickly blow through it to clear the clog and it should hit normally.",2022年11
3795,is there a permanent solution? i’m the op btw acc got banned for no reason,2022年11
3796,"overuse or poor storage usually. if you hit it too much it causes excess oils to rise into the air holes, otherwise if it's kept in a warm place not upright or even sitting in your pocket can cause the wax to flow easier, causing clogs. just take a tooth pick and scoop out what's clogging and remember to store upright in a cool area",2022年11
3797,"HEAT (think leaving it in the car, and it doesn’t have to even have to be that hot out, trust me)",2022年11
3798,Charging it with the pod in the battery can cause leakage,2022年11
3799,thanks,2022年11
3800,I fuck with the mango one. It's good for going to work or getting shit done. I don't come from a medical point tho so I won't speak on that. If you're looking for something that smacks hard  you're better off just looking for an indica like the Skywalker OG.,2022年11

3804,"legally, none. even when you’re of age. weed is a schedule 1 narcotic drug under federal law, airports and airspaces are federal. and i’m sorry kid, but if you’re underage and smoking then you gotta find it on your own like the rest of us did 😌",2022年11

Back to your question: illegal. Even when you’re of age.",2022年11

3809,Lmaoo,2022年11

3814,My big battery's been like that for like a year it's fine,2022年11
3815,"Unfortunately this is normal with the big ones :/
It’ll still work just fine tho",2022年11
3816,super ez fix. you just need gorilla glue and put a small dot on each side of the bottom and then push it up and hold it there for 30 secs and it’s like brand new! did this to mine as well!,2022年11
3817,"Quick fix: put a little super glue gel on the sides and slide it back up, wipe off the excess with a rag and it’ll never happen again",2022年11

3949,"rosin is kind of a marketing scheme, its been scientifically proven that terpenes dont mediate an enterouge effect, its done by the cannabinoids.

3951,"Um, yeah, no.

What is really a marketing scheme is when a producer \*cough cough STIIIZY cough cough\* is willing to OVER DILLUTE their concentrates with an abundance of Botanical Terps, for the sake of 'flavor' or informing their consumers that this product will hit anywhere CLOSE to flower or a higher quality concentrate extract like Cold Water Hash/Rosin. THAT is a scheme. Falsely delivering quality and using your company's popularity to misinform.

Also, to say that Terpenes don't contribute to the Entourage Effect, is ignorant and completely negates all the years of therapeutic/medicinal healing they have provided.

The entourage effect is a bunch of moving parts. not every role is as important as another, but together is WHY it's called The Entourage Effect. 

\*\*To the OG Poster, stop smoking Stiiizys. srsly. idk what their pod department is on, but its just not consistent and sustainable for a person. the amount of terps shoved into those pods messes up the actual chemistry of the high. I mean think about it, if you have a strain, it has a specific Terp Profile they breed for in order to get those same effects. Do you really think you are going tog et the same if you add a shit ton of Limonene? 

Try an actual Rosin Pen, idk where you are at but maybe look for some solid Rosin too.

Just sayin. I'm a Budtender from CA and I have seen some shit in the industry 0.0",2022年11
3952,What is entourage effect,2022年11
3953,I tried that too tho. Aside from the first couple pulls after a full charge it's just meh. Effects and smoke are a no go. I'll try their live resin next time. Live resin carts haven't let me down yet,2022年11
3954,That makes sense. I've tried only one other rosin cart and yea nowhere near the taste or smoke as dabbing some nice live rosin so I can see what you mean by rosin pods being a scam. I'm in Oakland so if you can recommend me a solid cart I'd appreciate it. (Currently enjoying this friendly farms x casa flor limon live resin cart),2022年11
3955,"The interaction between all the other cannabinoids and thc. If you smoke a regular stiiizy pod (even an indica) it has minimal other cannabinoids other than thc and it’ll feel very heady and more “sativa” like, when compared to flower or a live resin pod",2022年11
3956,"ah shit i’m sorry it’s still being an issue. at first i thought you were just shmackin the pod and over burning it, but i see we’re just having similar issues. personally, i don’t like the solventless pods that much. i had the same issue with a pod going bad and not hitting right. i recommend trying the CDT line of pods over the Live Resin. CDT hits so much harder and the taste is better than any of the Live Resins. they’re also typically cheaper than the solventless",2022年11
3957,"I know it's an older post, but I'm curious. What strain was it, and did you try taking it back when you realized it wasn't hitting right? Stiiizy is always good for refunds within 7 days at most dispensaries in California if it's a faulty pod, because Stiiizy reimburses them.",2023年3

3962,Thanks for the tips my bro 🤙🏽🤙🏽,2022年11
3963,Yeah they’ll have more CBD sometimes. But the LR pods have more cannabinoids than just cbd and thc while the other pods don’t,2022年11

I have those in the regular and big version. I use 2 strains for leg pain. When out and about, I keep them with me in the regular battery, because it's more discreet and will last until I get back home. If I'm going to be gone all day or maybe overnight, I take the big batteries.

This system also works very well when charging. I plug in all 4 regular batteries at once to save time. As each one gets fully charged, I insert the pod from the corresponding big battery, so as not to get pods mixed up and charge the big battery.",2022年11

By color coding them, I know which one I need for the symptoms I am experiencing. 

I don't get any medical benefit from GDP so that goes in the camo/rec battery. If I try a new rec strain and I notice any new medical benefits from it, then I get a new battery of a different color and add it to my rec collection. If I notice benefits that I already get from a certain strain, then I will use it as a substitute for that strain, should it not be available and use it in the battery that the strain it replaces was in.",2022年11

4018,I’ve never had a problem it actually helps sometimes the pods wiggle around but that extra thickness keeps them in place,2022年11
4019,Sometimes it’s better to call the day you had the issue and let them know you’re coming. So the issue is on their back burner and they’re at least aware when you walk in you’re probally not gonna buy anything and need help. I’ve had leaking carts/pens from dispos and they usually take it back within their return policy but if it’s hella low it could be up to their discretion,2022年11
4020,"I guess you can say that? But it was a full gram and it sucks when you pay 45$ for it then 3 days later it just completely busts. And it wasn't completely empty either and you could still test it where you get that burn from hitting it on your tongue. Like you could even hear it spit back, what sucks is that like I said the worker tested it too and told me it leaked. So it's kinda on them for not sticking to their own policies and giving me a rule that they just made up on the fly so they wouldn't have to refund me.",2022年11

4023,My bad didn't see this my guy. If you go to an actual stiizy store what I learned after this experience is always take pics or video proof. If you have pics of it leaking when it was at half or like 35% full they'll refund you on it fully basically giving you a new full replacement. An example of how I got a replacement fully is one day when my stiizy was leaking I spit out all the leaking juice onto a paper towel. It was really noticeable and I added a side by side pic of paper towel and leaky stizzy and they've been giving me replacements I have done this 4 times.,2023年3
4024,"Pull slow on the big batteries, like almost pull as soft as you can for as long as you can hit it till it flashes lights auto shuts off.

4036,"That tends to happen when you hit it to much on low battery; it doesn’t get hot enough to burn all the oil so it pulls through and clogs the mouth piece. Once the oil becomes clogged past the heating element it’s hard to hit.

4046,No worries! As long as it’s a licensed dispo they will exchange for FREE and u can keep the old pod since they can’t take the old ones back once u put ur mouth on em. But they get paid by stiiizy for any pods that are sent back for defects/problems like urs (not being fully sealed properly),2022年11
4047,"Don’t use a big stiiizy for solventless pods. Stiiizy released a suggestion to only use the regular battery, because the big one heats them up too much and you’ll get a burnt taste. 

But yes, They are darker because all the extra terpenes and cannabinoids from the flower aren’t lost in the extraction process like it is with distillate. Distillate is more clear because it’s basically JUST thc",2022年11

4093,Ya I think it's probably that i was hitting it non stop the other night. I let it sit overnight last night but it's still bubbly. I usually use the kurvana carts. I think I need to take a tolerance break. I rarely feel anything from the cartrages anymore.,2022年11

Sorry bro those usually still get u kinda high but NOTHING compared to what a real stiiizy would do as u said urself u noticed this shit didn’t feel like a stiiizy.

U have been smoking fake stiiizys my dude lmfao 🤣. Bruh I have been buying stiiizys from black market dispensaries first when I was dumb and naive and not using weedmaps and was getting these EXACT ONES in these boxes for months and months there literally everywhere right now if u don’t go to a weedmaps dispensary... then when I finally fuckin switched to a NON-black market, actual licensed LEGIT weedmaps dispensary over 2 years ago and kept using the dispensaries on their and never have I got this packaging again, and never have I ever got a stiiizy box like this kind again,(also NEVER have any of my REAL stiiizy boxes come with a stiiizy pamphlet I don’t recall ever 😆) once I started using legit dispos these disappeared all together and all the real dispos started delivering me real stiiizys with the real working QR code’s where I am finally the first snd only scan finally and oil that actually fucks me up and get me a good clean high instead of that just a weird tainted weak ass oil feeling like op describes.",2022年11
4122,"Ok was looking out for u since u couldn’t figure out how to scan the code for an entire day, FYI if u see these pods in Cali or other places it’s probably the number one most blackmarketed cart that’s out there is the stiiizys and they use this exact box with the flavor in the wrong spot, and the fake label made stickers exactly like this one they slap on the bottom where the flavor should actually be placed.. like the other guy posted in here said also, it should be a sticker of the flavor not ever like this, all the black marketed ones look like this so I would be careful in the future. Also if u wanna post the box to prove it that would be nice and actually I would believe u if u did that..  also its “ineffective” were ur words bro lol which only make me believe it was more a fake, literally nothing matches at all haha.

4124,These things got an expiration date or somthin?,2022年11
4125,Bro lol your so wrong on this but whatever you do you and believe whatever you want the fact is that stiiizy have had now 3 to 4 different versions of the packaging and stickers to counter fakes and one of those is the one above if you had a packaging similar to the one above and it was a fake well sorry for you but that does not mean that the packaging and that sticker never existed as a legitimate packaging from stiiizy your info is wrong and if you knew how to read the batch numbers and dates you would know it’s a legit batch number and it matches the date,2022年11

Never got a legit one that looked like this and why are u saying the batch number is correct with the date?!? Did u seal the thing in stiiizys factory are u the batch checker? If not then don’t say the shit checks out. Cause I can read fake batch numbers that don’t correspond to anything all day it doesn’t make anything legit. The fact u got fake stiizys and haven’t learned to switch yet is beyond me. There haven’t been a stiiizy box like this made for over 2+ years now. I know because I’ve been smoking stiiizy carts legit for that long from real dispos 2/3 carts a week... that’s more stiiizys then u have smoked in ur life. Also I just looked and I still have old stiiizy boxes laying around from 5/21 and THEY WERENT THESE BOXES 🤣.

And u get to keep both no extra charge! As long as it’s a licensed dispo they will be subsidized and paid for by Stiiizy for the defective ones they ship out so the shop doesn’t mind to send u a replacement for free.

I believe it's because they are getting ready to shut it down. What makes me say that you say? Last week I got one that didn't have a QR code at all. That's because it was a new box that is not only child proof, but tamper proof as well. You can't just push a button, open the box, replace the OG pod with a fake and close it back up anymore.

4191,"I don’t understand why everyone’s calling fake on this. As a resident of El Dorado Hills, located up in Northern California, that price is pretty standard. At any stiiizy store you can find live resin pods, full gram any strain for around $10-$25. Most of the time, dispensaries have their own markups. But those markups aren’t insane, especially if you go to a smoke shop that’s a stiiizy licenced carrier. I can find a full gram live resin at a local licensed smoke shop for $30 and they get cheaper as you get closer to big cities and further into the valley and SoCal. These are definitely not fake, and stiiizy just seems to be mass producing the live resin and promoting those over the distillate since it is cheaper to make. The live resin burns differently and a bit faster depending on how you hit it so it makes sense that this is the case. It’s also much cheaper to make resin. You can find resin dabs for dab rigs for around $8 for 3.5g equivalent. That’s the same shit they’re putting into the live resin pods and why it burns faster. Hope that helps!",2022年11

4212,No no I mean the ones that sell for 30-40 bucks the QR code doesn't scan it goes to the website but the number comes out red. Not Authentic.,2023年6

4214,cheers mate!,2022年11
4215,What time did you get there? Like how early before doors opened and how long was the line?,2022年11
4216,How does one get a what looks like a care package? That's a lot of stuff,2023年3
4217,Mofo used a cheat code,2023年1
4218,I got there about 1030 it opened up at 10 so I was lucky 🍀 but I recommend you get there at least 20 minutes before  tomorrow morning in Battle Creek another grand opening at 10am,2022年11
4219,I went the grang opening in Kalamazoo Michigan bro,2023年3

4223,Just in price it’s more expensive in Chicago but quality is better actually maybe 🤔 cuz it’s freshly made here,2023年3
4224,sometimes stiiizys system glitches out and will show a previous scan in the future or something like that. there’s been quite a few posts on it the past couple years on here,2022年11

4237,Idek what stixxy is man tbh i thot it was like a rtpj accessory,2022年11
4238,Really is this fairly common as of recent? I emailed stiizy directly but no response yet,2022年11

4240,"I had the same thing happen, mine showed up verified 20,000 times on an imitation cart and that means it was copied 20,000 times. Not to say the distillate doesn’t hit, it’s just not Stiizy",2022年11
4241,yea there’s a couple posts in the past week or so abt that issue if you scroll down in the sub,2022年11
4242,I emailed 2x b4 I got a reply.   Email them again!,2022年11

4244,They just verified they were real,2023年2
4245,How it is?,2022年11
4246,i try to avoid pods with added flavors,2022年11
4247,Yes i got on a grand opening 3 weeks ago,2022年11
4248,Yup its gas. Probably the best if not one of the best flavored pods to date,2022年11
4249,"Not big on the flavored pods as it's just thc and cbd and not strain specific meaning they are all the same just different flavors.

Rosin and resin pods burn.

Cdts are perfect.",2022年11
4250,apple fritter was too much for me,2022年11
4251,💯,2022年11
4252,"The pods 100% have different strain affects. All (if not most) the pods are named after a specific strain, and as someone that’s smoked a few different types, the highs are very different

For example, they have OG Kush, Blue Dream, and King Louie XIII. The highs are cleaner than smoking bud though. But I’m pretty sure those pods provided by Stiiizy are made using the actual strain.",2022年11
4253,"It's not though bro. It literally saids on the box. Thc and CBD.

The CDT resin and rosin have more of the terpines and canabanoids.",2022年11
4254,"The box is just saying it has those components. And they still have extracted terpenes. The highs are just as strong as the resin pods, trust me. The highs are similar",2022年11
4255,if u got it from a liscenced dispo nothing to trip about bro. smoke that shit up n eat sun cereal,2022年11
4256,"get your pods from a licensed dispo, scan it (make sure it's the right site), if everything's fully verified & you're sure then there isn't much reason to trip (unless ofc your dispo is dirty)",2022年11
4257,Depends. where did you get it …? Lol that’s the answer for your question,2022年11
4258,Did it verify on scratch code?,2022年11
4259,from a plug that says he gets it from the dispo,2022年11
4260,would it be weird to ask my plug what dispo he gets em from,2022年11
4261,hmm probably not from a dispo but if it’s getting u high and not making u choke to hard or any suspicious tatste then ur fine bro bro,2022年11
4262,i mean it's a valid question but he could literally just say any licensed dispo in your area capping of his ass. are there any like sticker labels on your boxes that look like they're most likely from licensed dispo stock?,2022年11
4263,yes but they look sketchy,2022年11
4264,"Which pod is it? That would happen to every blue burst pod I had, and also had a mutual friend who all of her blue bursts would leak too. So I decided to stopped buying blue burst all together",2022年11
4265,"I’ve only had it happen sharing my pod, too much heat for extended periods of time always messes with it.",2022年11
4266,"Blue burst is my go to for pain from a broken leg. I have gone through dozens of pods, this and other strains, and have never had this problem with any of them. I keep all my pods, be it in the box or in the battery, in an upright position to insure the wax stays in the bottom of the pod. Maybe I'll try laying one on it's side to see if I can make it leak.",2022年11
4267,Yeah I would keep it in the box and upright as well and it still had leakage :(,2022年11
4268,"Every time I’ve used it, it’s been cash only",2022年11
4269,Use a delivery service that allows debit? Ive never paid cash,2022年11
4270,you can’t. cash only.,2022年11
4271,That’s crazy because I called they said that the delivery driver has a debit card reader but it has too be a debit card with a chip and that it’s 3$ more,2022年11

4274,I’m so happy I’m I live in LA,2022年11
4275,DANG!!!!!!! Where did you get that at that price?  I'm not trying to pile on but the dispo I get mine from you'd have gotten 20+ grams.  Wherever you are surf the net and look around there are much better deals out there.,2022年11

4277,What’s the difference in solventless?,2022年11
4278,This is about 600 where I'm at. Maybe over a little.,2022年11
4279,This like 250 in my county 😂😂😂 no joke I even went on the website to compare,2022年11
4280,They sell packs like this?,2023年1
4281,Same,2022年11
4282,I live in nyc and my plug sells stizzys for $65. The solventless one are $50. Do you have a site that sells legit stizzys for cheaper? The best price I can get an a normal stizzy is 50-55,2022年11
4283,"They have og pot, live resin pod, cdt pod, rosin , solventless . Look it up on they’re website gives u all the info u need😉",2022年11
4284,Yea I pay same LA right?,2022年11
4285,I was just about to say I can get that for around $300 or even way less if the dispensary is having a promo on that day.,2022年11
4286,I get mine in MI and they're a lot cheaper I get grams for anywhere 3-$100 up to 2-$95 depending on if it is a live resin et al.  I heard that the dispos in NYC were selling Stiiizy if you're close to Canada you may want to look at the Ontario dispensaries.,2022年11

4294,No,2022年11
4295,Its for michigan products only.,2022年11
4296,The light should be on the whole time it’s plugged in. When the light turns white it’s good to go,2022年11
4297,Thank you for answering the question,2022年11
4298,"Yep, normal. Just put it straight up and the oil will adjust itself and the bubbles will probably vanish",2022年10
4299,Ya super normal,2022年10
4300,U gotta take a break before hits bro 😂😂 that’s too many hits in a small span of time but ur good it’s normal to have bubbles,2022年10
4301,that’s normal just have it sit upright and they’ll all go to the top,2022年10
4302,"Yep, totally normal. Put upright and take a huge hit and it should heat up the oil enough to make the bubbles “rise”. Many carts will do this in my experience",2022年11
4303,Thanks bro I was worried 🤣,2022年11
4304,"USB C, sooner than later. Additions of buttons, I would be surprised to get anything past a single button. It’s about ease. There are plenty of vapes available for temp control, but stiiizy may just keep it simple.",2022年10
4305,"Once a better design forces them to update in order to retain consumers realistically.  


I know every stiiizy rep I meet thinks I'm looney toons because I keep bitching about this but for 20$ a battery they should have a C charger, at least SOME degree of variable voltage and a tad better battery cut off protection. This is why I just suggest people make adapters and jump ship from stiiizy batteries all together until the company updates its battery tech.",2022年10
4306,I dunno but I would really love one with USB C it sucks keeping an old micro usb charger around for just one thing,2022年10
4307,I need a hurry up and look into how people wore their own batteries so I can use a lower temp for solventless pods,2022年10
4308,"It’s honestly absurd at this point that they haven’t at least put out a low voltage version (even if it’s not variable, just pin it at 2.2v) for the solventless pods. So much rosin going to waste…",2022年10
4309,"Eh, maybe on the Biiig but temp controls adds too much complexity. I like that stiiizy can survive a beating and drops.",2022年10
4310,It would make them hella money considering everyone agrees usb type c is the meta and some low voltage would make the pods last even longer,2022年11
4311,What do you mean by make adapters?,2022年12
4312,I’ve been thinking of a stiizy//510 thread adapter for like a year now,2022年10
4313,">Photo of prototype

all my Stiiizy batteries have a microusb magnetic adapter. We use them on just about everything, so our charging cords have a usb adapter, making it super easy to charge.

4314,They need a low voltage battery imo to handle the solventless pods,2022年11
4315,[Photo of prototype](https://imgur.com/a/WBVy9Kj),2022年12
4316,"I've built a couple dozen at this point for mentioned reasoning, still trying to get autodraw off a 510 battery to work through the adapter at the request of a friend but otherwise works just fine with any regular ole 510 battery system with a fire button and it really changes the game for the solventless pods.",2022年10
4317,That’s literally the directions you aren’t supposed to use the Biiig,2022年11
4318,"Oh excuse me, I see you're in Beast Mode lol. That looks so sick.",2022年12
4319,You should really post a tutorial!,2022年12
4320,"Oh excuse me, I see you're in Beast Mode lol. That looks so sick. How does it hit and you can of course change voltage right?",2022年12
4321,If there was enough interest in the community I would,2022年12
4322,"Beast mode lmao, more like cheap mode. them stiiizy batteries cost a lot for almost no features beyond ""compact""  


In the picture is a typical regulated ecig battery, (I think a eleaf pico or something) that allows me to control the hits via wattage or voltage as well displays you the coils resistance off the head of a typical cartridge well my adapter is just a housing holding a 510 connector male (salvaged from one of those shitty ego battery chargers that thread into the battery) wired into two respective pogo pins at the distance to mate up up the stiiizy connecter and two little 4mm magnets to retain the stiiizy cart and hold it secure to the pogo pins. my adapter only achieves adapting stiiizys proprietary connector (of the carts) to any regular 'ole ecig battery you can find just about anywhere for well cheaper than a stiiizy battery.   


Obviously there are many issues with a system like this since you would be able to apply vastly higher voltages than the stiiizy carts coil was intended for as well as lower voltages but make no mistake all the real magic for temp control of your hit is just a smarter battery than the one stiiizy sells.",2022年12
4323,It looks well made! It's ingenious. They really need to come out with a stiiizy with variable voltage. Are you willing to sell one of those adapters by any chance?,2022年12
4324,"May I ask, is the part where the pod goes in 3D printed?",2022年12
4325,yup,2022年12
4326,I don’t have access to the live resin ones but the purple skittles is one of the best pods out of the other kinds. Rainbow sherbet is my favorite.,2022年10
4327,the purple zkittlez strain is so good,2022年11
4328,CDT🔥🔥🔥🔥,2022年10
4329,How’s the pz,2022年10
4330,Really bad experience with rainbow kush but at the time it was the best thing ever. Holding onto a half gram until it feels better to smoke.,2022年10
4331,That purple zkittles lookin 🔥🔥🔥,2022年10
4332,what do you think about the Rainbow ? i had zskits and it was so good had me relaxed typa high,2022年10
4333,"pls help, why are they black. 
I thought only the disposable pods came black like that",2022年10
4334,Fire. A little light tasting but it’s delicious. Had me chillin,2022年10
4335,Wdym bad experience?,2022年10
4336,Dude it’s FIRE,2022年10
4337,original line uses grey boxes for full gs and white for half’s. cdt and live resin line use white boxes for fulls and blacks for half’s,2022年10
4338,"Way greened out shivering and borderline psychosis 💀. Nothing to do with the strain, I believe the strain is amazing, just happened to smoke too much, smoke a weird combination of strains, and I was pretty stressed at the time. I can’t tell you how much I loved rainbow kush though amazing strain and I loved to mix it with other strains like 2 hits rainbow kush, one hit biscotti gelato.",2022年10
4339,hmm i just got rainbow lush and tbh this time i got the live resin one but i chose Wtrmln lr but they ran out i had the cdt one and didn’t like the high i’m hoping the live resin is better,2022年10
4340,Haven’t tried both a live resin and cdt of a strain but it would be a good idea. Being live resin though quality control/ variation is an issue. My first one gram rainbow kush was the best thing I ever smoked period at the time but the second half gram I got was just alright,2022年11
4341,Can’t even front that grape sorbet hits really nice I remember I got one on my last trip to Cali,2022年10

4353,Did they scan on verified.stiiizy not verified-stiiizy,2022年11
4354,It said something like your product is authentic enjoy,2022年10
4355,Yea verified.stiiizy,2022年11
4356,Did it say a number like how many times it been scanned b4 u,2022年10

4383,I fly domestically with pods all the time but idk about another country it’s risky,2022年10
4384,I've flown 501 carts to MAD several times. Always just put them in my toiletries and battery in my work bag. No issues so far,2022年11
4385,What r customs like? Do they check ur bag again when u arrive? I never have an issue bringing it with me on the plane but I’ve never been out of the county before,2022年10
4386,honestly i would go on ahead and throw all pods in a toiletry bag no labels on em and the battery right in ur pocket,2022年10
4387,"i wouldn’t be able to tell you on plane tbh mate, i’ve travelled out of the country with pods and carts but it’s been by car. 

last time i left the country was to go to mexico for a wedding. i got two carts in, and two of my brothers got 2-3 carts in each. I just put the battery under the seat and the carts in my sock.  Car was searched, we weren’t but never found anything. 

Europe seems to have stricter laws, and with cannabis being legalized in the states they’re probably gonna be more on your ass.

I asked my brother for some advice and he said your best bet is to just look confident, they’ll ask for your passport ID etc and how much money you’re carrying since if it’s more than 10 grand you have to declare. 

If you don’t give them a reason to search you once you land, they won’t search you. just act like a normal tourist fam, if they find it just tell them that it’s a vape. make sure you choose the strains that don’t leak

I wish your friend the best of luck mate, and hope that they get blazed on their trip :)",2022年10
4388,"that’s what a lot of ppl do, im just a paranoid folk so i’m just extra careful and think it thru",2022年10
4389,Thank you for the advice I think I’ll be fine since I’ve been through tsa with weed and carts many times,2022年10
4390,Also my friend flew to Mexico with a stizzy and they did search her bag when they arrived but didn’t do anything about it which is just confusing,2022年10
4391,best of luck mate !,2022年10
4392,Hey so  how did it go? I’m going to Madrid in 2 months I wanna take 2 pods abd battery with me,2023年1
4393,"they’re more worried about the bud and all that. you can easily sneak a cart into mexico but you either finish it or toss it since bringing it back to the states is more risky 

plus if you give them 20-45 bucks they’ll leave you alone. the more you have the more you have to give them for them to leave you off the hook with just a warning",2022年10
4394,It went fine I was worried for no reason. You land in madrid and then you go into a line where they check your passport and then your on your way out,2023年1
4395,Awesome dude thank you for the response as well brotha !!! So u suggest to take them in carry on ? Or should I put them in my luggage?,2023年1
4396,"I didn’t check any luggage and just separated the battery from the pods, I threw the pod with a my toiletries and has the battery inside my wallet in my backpack",2023年1
4397,I brought 4 pods and one disposable also in my backpack,2023年1
4398,You think I should take pods or carts ? I feel like a cart looks less noticeable in my bag of toiletries ..,2023年1
4399,I’ve done it going to New York .. I just don’t know how’s it’s gonna be wen I land in Madrid,2023年1
4400,I think either one will be fine. I just brought stizzy pods and I flew from Cali to Atlanta then to Madrid. When u land there’s no security u just have to go to the passport check area and then go to the exit! You’ll be fine! Also my dad brought wax and a small dap rig no problem,2023年1

4403,Dont vape distillate 🤷‍♂️,2022年10

4408,You right you smoke that jersey mid bullshit 🤣🤣🤣,2022年10
4409,Yeah admittedly I didn’t pick it up myself my friend brought me a few back on a trip she took to LA but hey I’m not complaining 🤷🏽‍♂️,2022年10

4422,they legit ?,2022年10
4423,Lmao bro keeps lagging it 🤦‍♂️he told me today if he lags today I’ll take it as a sign that they fake,2022年10
4424,smhhh hate when plugs do that lol. hopefully they’re all good,2022年10
4425,The only thing the battery does is sends power to the heating element in the pod to turn the wax into vapor. I would bet that something inside the pod was damaged. Find a friend or maybe somebody at the dispo with a battery that you can try your pod in. I like to have a spare battery in case I forget to charge it or to test for problems like this.,2022年10
4426,"
Luckily the pod was almost gone so I’m getting a new pod anyway lol",2022年10
4427,"Stiiizy missed the mark on a lower voltage battery. Plain and simple: their battery is too strong for rosin… hence the complaints of it burning, etc.

Stiiizy putting “rules and recommendations” on the pods like ‘hit it for a couple seconds, take long breaks between hits’ is just a cop out for them not wanting to truly give a good rosin experience :/

For that, and the price… pass imo.",2022年10
4428,"Personally if you're used to buying rosin already then just stick with what you got. But if you're new to rosin or only smoke stiiizy and wanna try it's a great starter to get the experience. The flavor is much better than a regular stiiizy pod. But it is easy to ""burn the pod"" or just make it taste bad. 
In comparison to other rosins it's not the greatest but I wouldn't say bad. There are just way better tasting and way terpier solventless extracts on the market",2022年10
4429,"If you but it make sure you use a small battery and only hit it once every 1 or 2 minutes so you don’t burn the oil. It’s very different from the regular one, this oil is the most pure wax and will get u way higher than regular stizzy but they only sell in half gram and are expensive if your someone who finishes half grams in a couple days",2022年10
4430,"I just got the new solventless pod 3 days ago but i only have a big battery.The taste was good the first day and i followed the instructions but the pod is burnt, taste burnt and it barerly hits now. Only get the solventless if you have a small battery. I still have about a .4 and it barerly smokes.",2022年10

There were no dates on anything back in the day when I first got my medical card.",2022年10

4439,"only take 3-4 second hits, and wait at least 10 mins between hits to allow the pod to cool down. also, use a small stiiizy batt rather than the biiig ones, the biiig ones burn to harshly on solventless pods",2022年10
4440,"Use the regular battery , not the biig",2022年10
4441,Hate when it seeps through the bottom 🤦,2022年10
4442,I only have the big battery and it taste so burnt and it barely smokes. The smoke color is blue when i exhale. so im not sure if im even smoking the oil😭,2022年10
4443,It taste buttery on the inhale and nutty on the exhale and slightly skunky. The high is great it’s got a nice head rush that makes me feel tingly and grounded. Highly recommend,2022年10
4444,Did you ever figure it out?,2023年3
4445,If i see this at my dispo im fs gonna cop thanks for the recommendation👍,2022年10

4452,Awesome thank you!,2022年10
4453,I didn’t end up taking it because I got worried but if I would’ve taken it everything would’ve been fine honestly haha so just throw it in with the rest of your carry on stuff and make it look like you normally would,2022年11

4456,Blue burst def,2022年10
4457,"TRY CBD PODS they have melon and mango it's a nice balance.

If you want something stronger than try the full THC ones.

Decide between Hybrid, Indica and Satvia. Lots on flavors and different TIERS

Like the OG distillate, then theres CDT PODS (Cannabis Derived Terpenes) and last theres LIVE RESIN.

Different price points and different effects as well as flavors. Don't be afraid to ask questions and get down with what you like not a always what's recommended.

If you visit the Stiiizy website there's more info on the strains they have for each category.",2022年10

4465,I dont want sound ignorant. Or but where guys buying these from? You getting it from the stores right? Its crazy to me that stores doesn't know they sell fake ones.  This pg going get me started on checking my pods too. Ha,2022年10

I had a big battery that would cook the oil and burn my lips because the temperature control malfunctioned. I tried that pod in a new battery and it worked fine. That's why I like to have 2 or more batteries so I can test to see if it's a battery problem or a pod problem.",2022年10

Maybe you’re projecting 🙃",2022年10
4553,"Sure, it was good live resin (lemon creme for the sativa. Papaya indica) but it’s never the strain that gives me anxiety, it’s my inability to moderate that inevitably leads to me to the same exact situation, without fail: 

**overserving** myself, which leads to severe discomfort, which leads to self loathing, which leads to no good. 

I don’t respect myself when I’m high, but I like being high. If endorphs weren’t involved, the call would be an easy one- on paper, the call remains an easy one. 

In application…not so much. The fast onset and lasting debilitating effects of live resin (even shit distillate, tbh) are hard to argue with when one wants to “relax”",2022年10

4556,"Oh yeah, I always work through it. But my inner monologue went something like

 “bro do you even enjoy this? Are you proud of yourself? This happens once a day, is it worth the trade off? If you get rid of this, you won’t have to feel this way ever again.” 

Every time I convince myself that I can moderate my intake, the same thing happens: 

First week I’m fairly responsible, only get high twice (sativa early evening, indica late night) a day. 

Then as the days pass, more of my day is spent being high, until I hit the point where I get high immediately after my post-workout-lunch. And then I don’t do **anything** for the rest of the day except what I absolutely **must.** 

Kills my drive/ambition/self-esteem. But fuck does it feel good. I love being sprawled out on my bed playing video games, jaw finally unclenched, brain dumping endorphins, massaging my muscles with its beautiful feel good chemicals. 

ADHD, man. That instant gratification. I might buy some bud today, tbh, who knows. But if I do, I know I’m just prolonging the inevitable.",2022年10
4557,"Damn dude, I can relate hard to this. I also have ADHD symptoms and have an unhealthy relation with cannabis when I have it in abundance. A psychiatrist I consulted with to get my CBD prescription told me that what he considers to be the most serious side effect of weed is something called marijuana amotivational syndrome, which is basically what you described. Getting high early in the day and then not doing anything else, then feeling like shit for not being productive, leading to low self-esteem which is compensated by getting high again.    
It's really easy for people with ADHD to latch onto habits and substances which provide quick dopamine release. You have to re-educate your brain to get that dopamine from healthier activities, things that stimulate you while also making you feel like you're progressing towards something, either a personal goal or a passion you have. I'm guessing you're a creative person, I recommend channeling your energy into some type of art or craft (music, writing, woodwork, gardening, etc.). It's helped me a lot.    
I hope you can create a healthier relationship with weed. You don't necessarily have to quit it forever, just treat it like a reward after a day of hard work or a treat for special occasions, instead of a crutch like you said.",2022年10

Doesn’t help that the San Fernando valley has the tastiest fucking OG in the world.

4568,I had the same situation where I bought 2 stiiizy pods from a dispensary I usually order from and always scan as authentic products. But this time the first one said authenticate and the second one said your serial code is invalid even after I manually typed it in. The dispensary didn't know what was up with the code but was reassured they get their products from stiiizy. The box and pod correlate exactly with the scanned real one and is a live resin which is less likely to be faked so I'm sure it's real. Probably just an issue with the serial codes.,2022年12

Scratch it off, verify the code by scanning QR code and confirming it doesn’t take you to a fake URL (anything other than https://verify.stiiizy.com means it’s unequivocally fake) and when in doubt, manually type the number from the scratch off into the above.

Just so you know, I’ve had a stiiizy rep before through a friend. He spent $10k per month with invoices and shit. I rode along with him to the DTLA location and parked on the vendor side with him. Stiiizy wholesales their pods at around $32. Most plugs can’t get wholesale (you need a state license) so you’re looking at $38-50/g retail. 

Now your plug (lets say he’s in Houston, like me) has to have a connect buy your plug pods, and pay his connect, and pay shipping + postal insurance and pray the package isn’t seized. 

Now that he’s risked thousands of dollars on product being shipped and paid his connect profit, your plug needs to turn around and make profit for his work as well. Now he’s charging $20-40 profit on top of each pod because these fuckers were hard to get. 

$40 retail (per pod)

$1 shipping (per pod) 

$10 profit to the connect (per pod) 

$30 profit for your plug. 

You’re looking at $80-90/g for stiiizys in another state. If your plug is offering $30,40,50,60 a g… they’re fake. The profit margins just aren’t there.",2022年10

You have no idea what pods go for on the bm or backdoor. Just look at my posts. I only get legit product but I never ever I have paid even close to 32 a gram pod. You would cry to know what pods go for. Stop making fake scenarios. If a pack gets seized. You just proof it happened and they send another. All your bs facts. You would cry and delete this post if you knew what plugs really charge. Picking up 1 stiiizy pod is how I can see you paying so much. If a plug even told me 20 I’d laugh.

4751,"They actually have a buy one get one 50% off sale on the whole store this weekend randomly, Friday / sat.",2022年10
4752,"They just started to deliver in SD, so if you see your address isn't available, you can try like a shopping center or anywhere that's not public/gov owned, so no parks/schools. They deliver other brands and prices are great cheapest I've found anywhere.",2022年10
4753,"if u start to taste metallic taste, throw it out. but the oil looks fine. most carts/pods have a year of expiration date when made but if stored or i guess lost properly then you should be good. the high just won’t be as strong",2022年10
4754,i mean i’d be too curious NOT to hit it but i doubt it’ll taste very good 😂,2022年10
4755,"Smack that shit bruh. Just gonna lose some of the flavor profile and be super clogged up. One time I found a full gram in an unopened box in my room after I moved out and came to visit like a year later lmao

4760,[removed],2022年10
4761,Pull thru (hit the pod) multiple times without it attached to the battery. You can put it in front of a hairdryer or space heater to warm up the wax but just get it warm not hot or it’ll leak,2022年10

4768,it’s on its side no idea. keep it upright for the wax to fall to the coils on the bottom,2022年10
4769,I saw a decent amount on the side,2022年10
4770,Divide the number of hits you *could’ve had* in half because all of your oil is gonna be stuck to the sides now. Why are u caring about how many hits you have left if you’re not even taking the time to preserve what you have left?,2022年10

4772,"I bought this from a dispo (newbie here) and I completely just threw away the box so I can’t tell if it’s real? It’s a half, and it’s watermelon z. the box seemed legit when I opened it, the push was on the back of it and the tab at the top. I also don’t know how expensive the half pods should be so I have no clue if that is a tell or not.",2022年10
4773,Fake !,2022年10
4774,"Damn, thank you though",2022年10
4775,Yup this pod got taken off the market early 2019,2022年10
4776,"Older carts used to have the 3 lines but not since like 2019, and watermelon z is a semi new flavor. 

A way you could tell is with the older carts was that the three lines on a legit cart was in the plastic where on a fake cart you could scratch off the lines with your finger nail like it was painted on. 

Unfortunately you can just buy clear pods and batteries all on alli express in bulk. So scammers be scamming. 

Now carts say STIIIZY like they do on the battery. But the only way to know for sure is to have that scan code because only a real stiiizy will have a fresh code each box. The counterfeits use the same copied code on all their boxes so they can have thousands and thousands of scans.",2022年10

4785,"bro I'd you don't want those I'll take em !!

jk you got a good amount of hits left man enjoy it. I usually stop huffing it when either I'm getting very little smoke, or when I can start to taste chemicals. Usually around 1cm left of oil",2022年10
4786,Once they reach this level I call it a “graveyard” pod. Because there’s about 50-100 of them in my drawer. It’s like a graveyard of tombstones lol. But when I run out of money each one will last me 2-4 days until tasting burnt.,2022年10

4792,still a couple hits left but i feel like the flavor at that point is meh,2022年10
4793,Hell Ya man keep it smoking!! You’ll know when it’s out cause your hit will taste like metal. It’s not really bad for you but when it get to that your out,2022年10
4794,Those have a few left . But it says on the battery instructions it says to stop when it looks like it’s almost empty,2022年10
4795,It'll taste burnt. That's when I toss it.,2022年10

4802,frrrr lol (now that i think about it he probably has a lower tolerance. lucky him),2022年10
4803,I guess it depends on what size hits you take.,2023年6
4804,yes 😭 i usually get a new cart at that point,2022年10

Report to State board",2022年10
4888,yeah ive bought 1000mg canabutter before but for the most part those are gonna be very concentrated things that are meant to be used in small servings but usually candies amd gummies and stuff like that are gonna be 100mg and made from known companies and their gonna have their own name for it not just “nerdz rope” packaging from amazon but the laws are not so straightforward and theres always loopholes,2022年10

4902,it’s only happened twice  to pineapple express ever for me,2022年10

Do-si- happens a lot but sour D does it to(really the only two i pick up). I just got strawnana and it did it to me too. I pick up from the pomona stiz and rebud. They both have that problem. Atleast with stiiizy its easier to return.",2023年1
4905,"This keeps happening to me too; the pod will get clogged, i try to unclogg it by drawing and it spits oil. If i try blowing i to the pod, it blows the oil down into the bottom chamber.. so im either stuck with a clogged pod or forced to waste the oil lol",2023年2
4906,Same here… birthday cake is the only one that clogs. Weird,2022年10
4907,dude i was just thinking this. full g pods always seem to last longer for me than a half,2022年10
4908,Yes!  In my opinion with absolutely no scientific proof.,2022年10
4909,a half gram for anytging will last me longer than a full gram,2022年10

4920,Ppl are gaslighting him saying u can’t be high for 24 hours but very few people go until 19 without smoking any weed. And his first session is a medical grade concentrate. Not some backyard doobie in Ohio. This is next level smoke for a first timer and you could expect to see psychadelic/extreme effects,2022年10
4921,"Yes you are. This is his first time smoking. My first times smoking were like a 2.5G shroom dose the first 6 hours and then a 10/10 weed high for another 6 hours. And you wake up still “high” all of the next day until the evening. (it’s more of a spaced out grogginess, but for a newbie you feel still not sober) smoking cali dispensary wax for your first time is way different than smoking a black market doobie in highschool for your first high. It can be a psychadelic-like experience.",2022年10
4922,sounds like a way to start an addiction bru 💀,2022年10
4923,thanks ✖️,2022年11
4924,"I’ve snorted meth once (age 16) and smoked heroin once (age 17) and can confirm weed is the 3rd most addictive drug I’ve personally tried next to cigarettes and alcohol. (Social acceptance and ease of access is what makes them so deadly) heroin and meth are less addicting than weed because weed has no negative side effects while meth makes you feel shitty for longer than you felt good. (12 hour high that you can’t function on, 24-48 hour comedown… compared to a 4 hour high that I took my drivers test on, followed by a 2 hour nap and snack break lol) 

When I first started smoking weed it was once a month in highschool. Then it became once a week. Then once a day at night. Then the high at night didn’t last long enough so I’d smoke every afternoon and night. Then I couldn’t wait to smoke til after school so I smoked morning, afternoon, and night. This process continued until I was spending $1k a month smoking a gram of distillate per day. 

I still struggle limiting my sessions but I’ve gotten it down to 2-3 per day… it’s been daily usage for the past 5 years. First time smoking I was 14. I’m 21 now. I don’t regret my use because I actually receive a ton of medical benefits from cannabis but I will admit I am extremely addicted I can’t eat or sleep without it. I have taken tolerance breaks before. My longest break was 9 months from age 15-16. The entire time I was just wishing I could go back to smoking again. This is a part of my life and a part of me and that won’t really ever change and I’ve embraced that.",2022年10
4925,So you’re telling me not to take her advice right? 💀also i hope you ended up staying away from the other hardcore drugs wish u well,2022年10
4926,"Ye I only did meth and heroin one time each. 

Weed I have been addicted to since 14 years old.",2022年10
4927,this is a constant problem for me with some pods and i haven’t found a way to fix it,2022年10
4928,its nothing,2022年10
4929,ur completely fine dude.,2022年10
4930,No need to worry,2022年10
4931,Until it tastes like burnt cotton (which we allll know that taste) you are good to rip,2022年10
4932,pretty sure stiiizy uses ceramics too so idk if there would b cotton in there,2022年10
4933,I've seen this happen to 2 of my carts. still worked but was sketched out too.,2022年10
4934,"Bett, thank God cause its a brand new strawberry cough😂 I just get paranoid this plug is weird mann💯",2022年10
4935,Appreciate it man ill deffinately rip it until its burnt as can be😮‍💨,2022年10
4936,"Thats what im sayinggg bro thats what got me super sketched, but also impossible to have a coil for a vape without cotton involved somewhere",2022年10
4937,Get a biiig battery if that one’s not producing enough vapor. The smalls don’t create enough imo. Happy day to u tho.  What flavor? Have u tried the live or cdt pods yet? Good chance You won’t go back to the distillate pods I know I haven’t.,2022年10
4938,They have no difference in power just battery capacity,2022年10
4939,I would avoid the big batteries for micro metals.,2022年10
4940,big pulls harder lol,2022年10
4941,K well being that I’ve owned multiple of both I would recommend getting a biiig battery they 100% for sure produce more vapor. Even the stiiizy site says “bigger hits”,2022年10
4942,stiiizy actually advises you not to use the biiig on their solventless pods because of the difference in power,2022年10
4943,"not true.  original is 3.2+\-0.1 
and biiig is 3.4+\-0.1",2022年10
4944,How’s the battery gonna release micro metals if anything it would be the pod no matter the battery it itself is not going to cause u to come in contact with micro metals,2022年10
4945,Yea totally does 100% noticeable. Guy who said they’re the same battery obviously and very much so doesn’t have one. I’ll blink a small 3 times dif story with the biiig.,2022年10
4946,I think they’re real bc my dispensary does the $1 edible deals sometimes too! I couldn’t believe it at first either,2022年10
4947,Lmk if they get you high and then I’ll let you know. How many mgs?,2022年10
4948,They got me high but they’re dab concentrates seemed whack,2022年10
4949,"I've been trying to figure out if those are real too. I tried the triangles and the ones in a jar, but the QR codes don't work for their verify site and putting the serial numbers in just spins and won't show a result",2023年3
4950,If they are the same ones I’m thinking about there are 3 30mgs. My dispensary also did a deal on them awhile ago and they seem pretty fire,2022年10
4951,Yeah 30 mgs they’re the triangles,2022年10
4952,"I’ve been having the same problem, I recently got the Fruit punch splash, but it wouldn’t even get out of the spins on their website. Unfortunately the edibles have not done anything for me /: I ate all of them and felt absolutely nothing, and that’s wild considering i don’t go near edibles (this is my second attempt with them) 😭",2023年3
4953,"Are the pieces rectangles with the word ""STIIIZY"" pressed into them?

The ones I have will get me high, I just hope I'm high on THC and not heroin or fentanyl",2023年3
4954,Better to be safe than sorry i suggest testing it out if you think it has EITHER of those 😭😭😭,2023年3
4955,Yeah 1:1 would be decent until you build the tolerance,2022年10
4956,"I used to get panic attacks every time I ingested THC until I realized that I just can’t do it during the day and I only smoke at night, when I’m chillin watching TV or something",2022年10
4957,"yeah tbh i started smoking off a normal cart , so if ur looking something to ease in i think that will work",2022年10
4958,i get really bad anxiety attacks when i smoke even just a hair too much. stiiizy 1:1 will be great!,2022年10
4959,"Yes dude enjoy that 1:1 to start with. Just had a bad trip after coming back from a t break, took another break and started with that. Back to smoking moon rock but I’ll always love my 1:1 mango if my tolerance is low enough. I add the last part because with a higher tolerance it just feels like this fuzzy head high, nothing close to as good as a live resin pod.",2022年10
4960,"I understand, I get bad trips from time to time. Usually consists of either paranoia or dry eyes/mouth. But a 1:1 would be great and staying away from weed strains that can potentially cause paranoia/anxiety

I only smoke Indica or Indica dominated hybrids when I know my environment will make me paranoid or it’s been a hard day. 

Edit: Take a single hit off a cart, preferably small if you need to ease your way into it. Wait awhile and see how it affects you. Enjoy, take your time and do what makes you feel comfortable.",2022年10
4961,Yeah man handle it ! Soon you’ll be upgrading to the CDT pods mark my words haha ! Have fun & welcome back !,2022年10
4962,"As someone that always smokes the normal pods, I got the I think melon? cbd cart and I definitely didn’t get as high as I normally do but I did feel chilled out, so I think starting there would be good for you!",2022年10
4963,"hey man how did you like it? im a returning smoker too due to the same panic attack problem. also i have another question for anyone else reading, should i try a live resin indica pod since they offer more cannabonoids than distallate? thank you",2022年10
4964,Thank you I’ll pick one up,2022年10
4965,Okay cool ! Thanks brother i appreciate it,2022年10
4966,At worst just control your hits and don't take blinkers cuz it may or may not catch up to you,2022年10
4967,"Remember: you’ll hit the pod and think “meh im kinda high but it’s not bad” then you’ll hit it 3 more times. Then the first rip will fully kick and you’ll be terrified realizing you took 3 more after that and only the first one is kicking so far and you’re already baked af. 

So just take 1 blinker and then chill for an hour or two. If u didn’t feel it that’s ok try again tonight or tomorrow. Double doses cause max unnecessary anxiety",2022年10
4968,Is the battery pack fully charged? Does it charge normally with a cable?,2022年10
4969,"Return it, probably faulty mechanism",2022年10
4970,Smoke it harder,2022年10
4971,It's almost empty there is little to nothing left. That's why your tasting that taste.,2022年10
4972,I love the Stiiiz in nyc. So convenient!,2022年10
4973,Thoughts? Personally i think white rasberry is pretty fire,2022年10
4974,"White raspberry is absolute fire, mind asking where you got it?",2022年10
4975,🔥🔥🔥,2022年10
4976,"Just picked up white raz yesterday, fire strain",2022年10
4977,Stiiizy in nyc?,2022年10
4978,"Fuck the mets, always a disappointment",2022年10
4979,It's amazing they are so abundant in NYC. Only thing I find is the pods aren't super secure to the device like traditional screw in carts. Which makes me nervous in out of my pockets etc.,2022年10
4980,"I had that once, I didn't enjoy the taste.",2022年10
4981,"I pay 5, on LongIsland. But that’s wholesale",2022年10
4982,Yeah I gotta admit it’s very stealthy when I go out somewhere no one ever noticed what’s up and just a few hits and the job is done🤣🤣🔥,2022年10
4983,Gotta agree with you! Tbh the taste kind of reminds me of the skywalker og but I’m enjoying it,2022年10
4984,Yeah place is on W 30th and 8th ave it’s called Cannabis Culture,2022年10
4985,Haha yessir it hurts but I go back every year🤣🤣,2022年10
4986,They overcharging here in NY I bought a cart out of desperation in midtown and paid $70..but in all honesty I’ve never had a pod come out of my stiiizy the magnets are pretty good 👍🏽,2022年10
4987,"Tbh I like this taste a lot better then OG Kush or King Louis..but I have to stick to the regular ones cause that’s all we can get out here in NY, I miss the CDT pods in Cali 🥲",2022年10
4988,I'm paying $70 in lower Manhattan. It's still better then .5 gram carts from jersey dispensary's for $60.,2022年10
4989,My favorite is blue burst to be honest. The white raspberry tasted to citrus flavor for me.,2022年10
4990,I found a place in Jersey City that was charging 60 for stiiizy pods but I never be out there,2022年10
4991,Cant even lie I picked that one up in Cali and it’s amazing,2022年10
4992,Where at though?👀,2022年10
4993,It’s on JFK BLVD and Lake ST place is mad lowkey looks like a closed down place with all mirrored windows There’s a button for the door,2022年10
4994,The buttplug lol,2022年10
4995,I'm trying collected those adults happy meal toys lol,2022年10
4996,What’s the name of that big stiiizy box,2022年10
4997,Is that the adult happy meal?!?!,2022年10
4998,They don’t sell them. His dad owns stiiizy Michigan.,2022年10
4999,"Honestly up to you man. A stiiizy batt will limit you to only stiiizy products whereas a normal batt can be used with multiple different brands. If you get a normal batt, just be observant of the quality.",2022年10
5000,"I currently have both and it’s great! Went to the dispo the other day to get a stiiizy pod and they had ran out. Luckily I have a regular vape batt that I bought some carts for. That’s why I like to keep both types of batts on me. In terms of preference, like the other commenter said, stiiizy batt limits you only to their products whereas a regular one (I use the YoCan Uni Pro) is pretty universal and you can adjust the voltage. So depending on whether you want to just smoke stiiizy or see yourself branching out to other brands, either or works. I just say have both of you can 🤷🏾‍♀️",2022年10
5001,Run away from stiizy. You’ll go broke your better off using a 510 battery and carts,2022年10
5002,Pods or carts? 2 different batteries,2022年10
5003,"I'll always keep both because I love the selection that Stiiizy has. They sell a lot of strains that usually aren't available in cart form at my dispensary. I would definitely invest in a good cart battery though since the cheap ones tend to break at some point, and/or suck at heating the oil properly",2022年10
5004,"Regular battery all the way, theres just so many more tiers of features to be found elsewhere or diy.   
That said I made an adapter from 510 to the Dstz pod contacts because despite the shortcomings of stiiizys pod choice/battery offerings I REALLY prefer the flavor of just about anything I've bought from Stiiizy over anything else I've tried in a disposable cart up to this point.",2022年10
5005,Does stiiizy make better indica or sativa?,2022年10
5006,I prefer indica so I haven't really tried that many of their sativas. I do like their Strawberry Cough though,2022年10
5007,"Do you know why most people have a preference for Indica? Personally, I feel sativa makes me feel lazy and not creative like people say sativa does.",2022年10
5008,"Indicas help with my anxiety and insomnia. Sativas make me a little too talkative haha, or even paranoid sometimes. It also depends on the strain though",2022年10
5009,How does one know what a good indica strain is? There's so many names!,2022年10
5010,"I use leafly and weedmaps to get info about strains, plus recommendations from my dispensary. Other than that just trial and error! What kind of strain are you looking for?",2022年10
5011,"FOr some reason, i stop having uncontrollable laughter like i used to.",2022年10
5012,"your tolerance maybe be a little too high, try taking a t break or slowly cutting down. for example, instead of hitting it all day fry hitting it every other few hours, then go down to only at night when ur abt to go to bed",2022年10
5013,"go to the dispensary and get an indica pod w the highest thc and if it has any cbd in it, thats good too. cbd will calm you while the thc is gonna ease your mind and theyre both gonna work on making you sleepy XD i got a blueberry ( monster cookies ) left coast pod that smacks me pretty hard and is compatible with the stiiizy battery. id recommend that one",2022年10
5014,Indica Sativa Hybrid effects are all bullshit. Indica and Sativa are used to measure the leaves before they are processed into the weed we smoke. If you have a high tolerance and wanna sleep get a dab rig or start smoking less before you actually sleep.,2022年10
5015,But I only smoke at night that’s the thing,2022年10
5016,"then i’m afraid that if you didn’t buy it from a dispo, you got boof",2022年10
5017,Shii hop not 😪,2022年10
5018,"ya prob did holmes, sorry to bout that :(",2022年10
5019,It’s cool Yk but it’s js that dispo prices are hella expensive,2022年10
5020,"yuh that’s understandable, make it into an edible thr pods aren’t hard to open and since it’s distillate (i’m assuming it is) then it’s already activated so just put a little oil on a cookie rice crispy etc, eat it and wait for it to take effect",2022年10
5021,so pretttty,2022年10
5022,Ah thanks I have an idea for me and my gf now lol,2022年10
5023,I laughed too hard at your username. Good shit.,2022年10
5024,Cute!!!!,2022年10
5025,AHHH they’re so CUTE!!!,2022年10
5026,whats the difference? does the biiig burn the taste? have u noticed any pros and cons between the two?,2022年10
5027,So cute 💗,2022年10
5028,definitely heavy on it tasting burnt! there’s times where i prefer the standard battery,2022年10
5029,W,2022年10
5030,"""ages 4 and up"" i like it XD def gonna get some candy at the gas station and use ur hack thanks bro",2022年10
5031,Keep upright and dry,2022年10
5032,this is valuable information,2022年12
5033,Forgot to mention it keeps your pods upright,2022年10
5034,Solid 👏🏽. Please pass it along and let me know if you end up liking the setup,2022年10
5035,Ik it's a dumb question but are you supposed to keep your pods up?,2022年10
5036,You are! Otherwise the oil can leak out or settle in a way that ruins the pod before it’s run out,2022年10
5037,"Oh shit , thanks bro I did not now that",2022年10
5038,Their js aren’t bad but the blue dream one is terrible,2022年10
5039,why?,2022年10
5040,"My wife doesn't like to feel high so I got her that juicy melon half gram she smokes it off her biiig stiiizy battery.

I tried I myself and it does give you a nice mellow body high and keeps your mind stimulated and ends up with a relaxed feeling overall. Flavor is on point.",2022年10
5041,"after a few minutes, i wanna sleep. i miss it.",2022年10
5042,That’s my favorite vape for anxiety and sleep. You won’t be disappointed… ENJOY!,2022年10
5043,"I've used that one and the mango 1:1. It's my go to since it's a very mild, mellow feeling. You're definitely not going to zooted off it, but that's why I like it.",2022年10
5044,It's great. Sometimes feel higher off that than normal pods.,2022年10
5045,"It’s good.. you’re not high high,… I feel like it just mellows you but you’re alert too! But not paranoid.  But everyone is different",2022年10
5046,Thank you,2022年11
5047,Yeah for me I'm already alert. Sometimes TOO alert. So I need something to mellow me out and chill. Not looking for an upper but more of a relaxer,2022年10
5048,i bought the big and definitely regret it lol - pod jiggles,2022年10
5049,Small because the big battery is dogshit quality,2022年10
5050,Small Stiiizy 💯💯💯but I use the big stiiizy battery to finish off the end of my pods 💨,2022年10
5051,Big battery has a higher temp uses more oil.,2022年10
5052,plug n play,2022年10
5053,Yup.... Small for sure,2022年10
5054,Got the same red big one. I bought two regular ones and two bigs and my two regular ones only hit sometimes which is weird and annoying so I use my bigs.,2022年10
5055,bigger all dayyy,2022年10
5056,"Dude I thought I was the only one. Thing is barely holding on. I already foresee myself losing one of these pods. 

Has to be a way to secure it better.",2022年10
5057,"i have lost a pod already , sucks",2022年10
5058,Try blowing into it. Oil might be clogged,2022年10
5059,"just air bubbles, they happen to every pod tbh after a few hits then it goes away until you are close to finishing it 👌🏽",2022年10
5060,Could be your battery. I bought 2 regular stiiizy batteries and 2 biiig batteries and both regular ones my pods never hit. The light comes on like I’m getting a hit but nothing. I switch the same pod to the biiig stiiizy battery and no issues. Idk it’s weird.,2022年10
5061,Happens a lot. Try leaving it upright when not in use helps a bit for me.,2022年10
5062,Rule number one always leave it up right. Rule number two never leave it in a hot car it will fuck it up. And don’t leave your battery in too long to charge it takes about 1 hour. I’ve noticed that if you don’t leave your battery plugged in a bunch it will last longer.,2022年10
5063,"cart is just clogged, hit it for a little to heat up/ loosen the wax and youll be good! its super annoying but happens often",2022年10
5064,"i did, thanks!",2022年10
5065,"Yea should come out in the next few days new stiiizy ediables 2:1 thc:cbn ( midnight berry , white berry , crimson berry) .. STAY TUNE 🔥💯",2022年9
5066,"I’ve had some good luck with pods and some of their rosin jam, but they’re nothing crazier. You can 100% get better for cheaper",2022年9
5067,Im not surprise stiiizy uses the same oil and same waxs on all there shit name it differently its common practice also with jungle boys everytime “new” strain comes out,2022年9
5068,Last 2 I bought leaked no more Stizzy anything,2022年9
5069,Their diamonds are cut with distillate. I’m not a fan. But on the other hand their live resin is great,2022年9
5070,Bro you should know stiiizy is trash af expect their pods,2022年9
5071,[deleted],2022年9
5072,"Yeah stick to their pods, and only the LR or solventless pods",2022年9
5073,I’ll buy all other products they have** just not diamonds if I’m using the puffco that’s furrsureee 🙃but just curious if I was the only one…,2022年9
5074,For 25$ lol expect it be trash u get what u pay for,2022年9
5075,Been buying stiiizy diamonds for months now. They have 4gs for 100 on fridays so I’ve been on that deal and I’ve been really happy. I smoke outta my carta and rig and the flavors have been awesome. I buy my stuff directly from a stiiizy shop so maybe yours was messed with? Or possibly fake because I know the stiiizy pod scam was super common. Truthfully have no complaints over the diamonds so it might be the puffco. My friend has one and has been complaining about it a lot recently.,2022年10
5076,Yesss the Pods I’ve never had an issue! And yeah totally agree. But I’ve had a battery not shut off before tho and had to throw it in a water bottle 😂,2022年9
5077,Oh definitely.,2022年9
5078,Awhhh man that’s not cool. Have you tried getting it somewhere else …maybe? But I feel ya that would’ve done it for me too 🤦🏻‍♀️,2022年9
5079,Bro you obviously didn’t read it all LOL but thanks anyways 😂,2022年9
5080,Felt this. 😂 but they lost me all after lastnight. Lmao,2022年9
5081,Thanks I totally agree now officially 😂. But I’d pick plug n play any day …just more shops carry stiiizy. But I was just thrown off by it because I never had an issue with them really… i prefer WCC but I wanted to switch it up last night because I was being lazy going off delivery 😂… but was hella curious if anyone did it in the puffco too cause that was yikkkkeeesss 😂,2022年9
5082,why do you say that?,2022年10
5083,"Low key 1000+ ppl on Reddit would agree with me saying Stiiizys CDT pods (AKA The Silver Line) is a million times better then their BDT line, and their LR line, because stiiizys battery’s can’t go low enough in volts for LR. and the SVL is 90 a Gram VS. 52 a Gram for the harder hitting, BETTER tasting CDTs.",2022年9
5084,I never said it was FIRE and it’s 40 not the 25✨ but it’s available to me once in a while I’d grab it.. but once I got the puffco 🤢🤢 it’s a no for meeeee. But on the rig I ain’t hatinggggg but that’s just my opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️,2022年9
5085,I’ve budtended for 7yrs in LA you know damn well I only buy the real stuff. 😊 but still stiiizyy isn’t MY go to & never will be…but if I have to grab it I definitely will and smoke it on glass.. Sorry I ain’t no die hard stiiizyy Fan Lol definitely not something I go out looking for and I’d I go to the stiiizy store I’m lookin at other shit lmao if you know they don’t only sell stiiizyy…. So much better stuff out there. And my puffco was brand new at that time fyi. So it wasn’t the coil or anything 👍🏻,2022年10
5086,I didn’t once I seen stiiizy I was like this goof ball ⚽️ 😵‍💫😂,2022年9
5087,"Stick to the pods but DEFINITELY NOT THE LR pods. The SVL is great if u wanna pay 45$ a half g..... 

OR go with the BEST of all the Stiiizy pods which is their CDT line which fucking smacks harder then any other ones and tastes fuxking literally amazing from the CDTs directly related to the strain u wanna smoke. 

Trust me. Stiiizy OG here wouldn’t steer u wrong.",2022年9
5088,thoughts on plug and play and maybe if it’s a better alternative than stiiizy? only concern is the pods are 40 and my stiz ones are only 34,2022年10
5089,"Better quality and taste, especially the solventless. And their concentrates just aren’t good tbh they’re cheap but they taste like solvent",2022年10
5090,They’re okayyyyy I’m just not a fan of the taste they have going on but I’ve tried the CDT line the few times don’t get me wrong I was excited when they first came out. Of course. Just Didn’t stick with me enough to be a go to 😅but I do have a good friend that’s a huggeee fan of the silver line.,2022年9
5091,Sounds like you just have a strong opinion on stiiizy and that's alright. I don't necessarily love or hate them but I've found they have the best bang for your buck compared to what's offered in other dispensaries. I can't find quality diamonds like stiiizy for the same price but that's just the diamonds.,2022年10
5092,What because I never tried stiiizy in a puffco and I did once you call me a goofball 😂😂who the fuck uses that word a 10th grader 💀💀💀💀,2022年9
5093,CDT smacks iykyk 😮‍💨,2022年9
5094,Personally .To me I think so. I’m a huge fan of Taste and high. But I’ve had them all…. Even the Silver line of stiiizyy is OK too… but wasn’t anything special to me…they both are definitely more $$$ and they both don’t come in half grams. 🤷🏻‍♀️ stiiizyyy is bang for your buck & have more carriers. Just my opinion,2022年10
5095,Yea I’ve just tried it all and I’m just a picky about my medicine what can I say …. & I know what I personally like! (Nowadays) . But if you haven’t - Try west coast cure diamonds they are priced good and sold at stiiizzzyyy. !,2022年10
5096,Hahahah awwwee did I hit you in the feelings pedophile ain’t nobody talking bout 10th graders weird fuck,2022年9
5097,Facts iykyk,2022年9

5102,"Plug n play doesn’t make half g’s and it’s my personal fav. I’m not a huge fan of stiiizyy carts taste. I’ll only grab them if I have to, (they are more common in shops etc) Even the silver line of stiiizy -it’s just not for me. I’d rather get plug n play any day 🤷🏻‍♀️",2022年10

5134,"I’ve had it so that with specific pods on my biiig battery. I’m guessing that means the pins arnt contacting the pod cause it would work on certain tilts like a bad microUSB cable.

5167,"For carts in general, solventless/rosin is often much more enjoyable, overflowing with terps that have been literally squeezed from the plant and delicious. Live resin is closer to the strains taste with the second most terp preservation of the most common extraction processes. Both have a more flower-esque “complete” high than distillate and CDT, with rosin being favored by purists. In general, both are worth it as a treat or daily driver if you ball like that.

With that said: the above is NOT true for Stiiizy, the platform is not the way to consume either and the fixed voltage batteries (especially the Biiig) are downright wrong for both concentrate types. The pod design lends itself to large hits of distillate, but you want a ceramic core and significantly lower voltage with fully decarbed concentrates that are going to get thin very quickly when exposed to heat and burn when exposed to 3v and higher. You’re wasting your money with LR/Solventless, because it’s not an upgrade in Stiiizy form. Get a 510 rosin cart and a CDT stiiizy and you’re in a better place with both.",2022年9
5168,Both fire,2022年9
5169,I prefer live resin ngl,2022年9
5170,Nothing tops the Live Resin in my opinion.,2022年9
5171,"Live resin all the way. Given the equipment, it’s barely better and not worth it for everyone to get either but I personally like live resin. I did try solventless too and wouldn’t call it a better experience but I did spend more money. I stick to live resin and cdt because I don’t find solventless worth it and og pods are just bad to me.",2022年9
5172,"I would say go CDT over LR and SVL. Stiiizy LR is terrible and the solventless is 90 a gram... 

CDT hits harder tastes the best and is only 2 dollars more then the normal BDT line.",2022年9
5173,ditto this,2022年9
5174,Yea if you wanna save and smoke something better then the normal stiiizys probably go to CDT they’re fire and not as much,2022年9
5175,CDT?,2022年9
5176,cdt is cannabis derived terpene pods,2022年9
5177,"Oil has roughly 1-2 years before it degrades to anything roughly noticeable. Even than all that happens is the THC converts to CBN depending on a variety of factors (cbn being the canabinoid responsible for more sedative effects). And that only loses up to 10% potency by that time period.

Tl;dr One month wouldn’t do much .. I’d toss it after a year or two personally but why would you even hold it for that long lol

Edit: I noticed your post is in concern of the battery. As long as that hasn’t been overcharged or anything funny like that you should be good",2022年9
5178,"idk man lil stiiizy (the disposable ones) suck,the batteries die before i get to kill the pod most times",2022年9

Distillate pods like these are just broken down thc that has no other terpenes in it, the flavors come added terpenes but don’t give you the real effect of the strain you’re trying to consume.

5315,I guess I’ll just say it came like that. It was already open when I got it and the wax was a little lower than normal so I’m assuming one of the workers was hitting it or something lol so ion really feel bad about it.

5316,"Cdt kicks live resins ass. The difference is the extraction method used. Cdt contains more terpenes because they extract them first and add them back in because you inevitably lose some terps in the extraction method for live resin I think. 

Terpenes are made up of carbon links and there are multiple sizes from monoterpenes to bigger terpenes with more carbon. The issue is that likes dissolve likes, Cannabinoids, mono terpenes and your solvent are non polar but the bigger terpenes are actually polar so you have to change your extraction conditions to get those terps.",2022年9

5326,"THC and CBD can provide temporary relief and mask the overall pain but you need to deal with the source, start making decisions based on ergonomics and make sure posture and support are dialed in. Source: multiple discectomy, spinal & neurosurgery, partial paralysis for an extended period and lots of nerve damage. Take care of yourself! I like a indica leaning hybrid rosin for gentle pain relief. Edibles are better for longer term relief and they make great solventless and full spec options now. If it’s truly not going to improve long term or surgery is not a viable option you eventually get numb to the pain but honestly that’s your body telling you something and I often miss the sensation when I need to hear the signal now/",2022年9
5327,Try stretches for back pain while thc is in your system so it doesn’t hurt as bad,2022年9
5328,"My back problem is that my prescription meds destroyed the soft tissues in my spine. I could feel each bone sitting on the next. OG Kush in a STIIIZY vape pod restored those tissues, separating the bones, restoring flexibility and getting rid of the pain. It even fixed a torn rotator cuff that they wanted to operate on.",2022年9
5329,"My doctor gave me an injection of cortisone in my shoulder. It felt good, until the local anesthetic wore off. I actually think it made it worse. Og kush has that shoulder and my back moving and feeling like new.",2022年9
5330,Because there's a lot more to cannabis oil than THC. It also fixed my bad knee that I was told even a full replacement wouldn't help. I couldn't walk on it for 6 years but I am now. I don't know how it works and I hope they don't figure it out. If they do they'll put a patent on it and make it by perscription only.,2022年10
5331,Norco and codeine don’t help for the pain anymore. I’ve grown a tolerance for pain killers as well. Had to go to hospital for a morphine injection since the pain was unbearable.,2022年9
5332,I have a small curvature from scoliosis. It’s not enough to warrant surgery or a brace. Specialist said an injection of cortisone in the spine or muscle would alleviate my pain if it persists. I really don’t want that because it’s a temporary fix.,2022年9
5333,"Why would THC restore soft tissue in your spine, let alone heal a torn rotator cuff? Doesn't really make sense",2022年10
5334,I’ve had the Apple fritter twice already and both times i enjoyed it. Put me to sleep haha,2022年9
5335,"I feel like that in general when I hit the 1g pods, so I just get the .5’s… haven’t tried that flavor in specific though.",2022年9
5336,Had that experience first time I had blue burst,2022年9
5337,i honestly think some of the “flavors” are too harsh to be smoked. idk if you’ve heard of jeeters but the sell infused pre rolls and have carts but after a while they start to hurt the throat. but all their strains are flavored and taste like the actual flavor it’s supposed to be,2022年9
5338,yeah apple fritter is a little too strong. it burned my throat from how it tastes.,2022年9
5339,I think it's the added flavors. Apple fritter hurt my throat too. It's way to harsh and the other some of the other flavored ones give me a headache after some time,2022年9
5340,I liked it. It packs a good punch.,2022年9

5345,how in the hell did you buy in bulks lol,2022年9
5346,Pineapple Express or King Louis!,2022年9

5357,What’re the CDT carts,2022年9
5358,SC always just tastes so good,2022年9
5359,Instead of the botanical terps they use cannabis derived terpenes so the flavor is strain specific and also adds to the entourage effects from different strains my favorite is the pink açaí,2022年9
5360,"Entourage effect is scientifically false. Terpenes should have the same effect whether they come from BDT or CDT, a molecule is only a molecule. Only difference is taste",2022年9
5361,i can never find pink açaí but it sounds soo good 😭,2022年9
5362,I would just take it in like a Juul,2022年9

5369,"Bro my bf got soo lucky that a girl in front of us in our bag check line got caught, bc the officer with the dog, threw it a treat to tell it he did a good job, and the dog was distracted with the chew toy as me and my bf walked past it with a stiizy. He said “sometimes you have to let other people take the fall” 😂",2022年9

5372,Need a update because same,2022年11
5373,"I’m not much of an intellect when it comes to differences in wax, but I did get a solventless pod recently after experiencing distillate many a time before. You’ll certainly notice a difference in flavor; it tastes much more like weed. In addition, I think it’s a little smoother on the throat, and the high feels more ‘clean.’ Even tho I didn’t get more high than distillate, I felt more clear headed and less bogged down",2022年9

It never leaves my house.,2022年9
5377,Yes it sucks but it happens towards the end. Fucking annoying.,2022年9
5378,i have the same problem with mine. Did the paper method too small world,2022年12

5431,Literally my thoughts. You got the box scratch that shit.,2022年9
5432,bc there’s ppl on here that are a lot more familiar w the product. plugs can still have real stuff and you can get counterfeit product from unlicensed dispos which ppl may not be aware of. all this stuff we can help with. your comment implies if you bought it from a plug it’s automatically fake which is just a silly mindset. lots of posts that show otherwise,2022年9

5444,"Exactly. 
You know if you picked it up from a well known dispo. Or a shoddy dispo. Or some dude saying he has the hook up. 

At the end of the day that, build quality, and the verification scratchers are infinitely more effective than … posting a picture to a forum.

Completely anecdotal but nicotine vapers have been hitting box mods hundreds of times a day for 2 decades and I’ve never seen a study link vaporization to heavy metal inhalation with good hardware. With that said, nowadays I’m much more selective about what I’m smoking and how long I’m heating the element of my far higher quality devices…

5619,The dispensary I used to work at did this deal once every two weeks. But ngl it was BUSY almost every time,2022年9
5620,Yeah it seems the free pod they gave me just passed expiration. Makes sense now why they give them out for free.,2022年9
5621,"The scratch off is under the sticker and the measurements are on the stickers on the backside with all the test results.

5622,3 dispensaries in my area do this deal almost every Friday and it’s not too busy,2022年9
5623,"i could be wrong im no expert but i kinda bounce around from different shops a lot of time so im always going to different shops and my stiiizy packaging is always the same. im like 90% sure stiiizy doesnt design different packaging it wouldn’t really make sense i dont think, so that is something that would definitely sus me out… ive also never seen a stiiizy box with the verification not in the right too corner that would be kind of a red flag for me. have you scanned all the barcodes yet tho? cause i know there is ways to fake the verification codes some people just assume their legit if they have the scratch off but sometimes you scan the scratch off and it says its been verified 2728329 times or whatever ya know. ive also been to shops that sold me a stiiizy woth no sticker at all and the packaging was their OG packaging before they upgraded the childlock system on their boxes… again i could be wrong things vary a lot state to state… buttt that would just be too many red flags for me",2022年9
5624,"except different states have different packaging laws. for the longest time cali was the only state to have scratch off verifications. MI got it around a year ago and other states then followed suit (Arizona, Nevada). also nevada/arizona stiiizys aren’t faked, only the cali ones and this isn’t one of em",2022年9
5625,not sure if you read what i said but i mentioned that things vary state to state and i could be wrong idk what state the original poster is from so thank you for repeating what i said 😊,2022年9
5626,"yes and you also commented saying how this would be too many red flags for you, this is sus, etc etc. i’m clearing up the confusion for you on how stiiizy operates. not sure why you’re getting passive aggressive when someone’s trynna give ya good info 🤷‍♂️",2022年9
5627,because i live in california so for my state that would raise a lot if red flags thats why i mentioned things vary state to state so theres no confusion you didn’t really clear anything up again you just repeated what i said and anyone can easily make fake stiiizy packaging in any state they want even stated that stiiizy isnt sold retail in its really not hard at all so where’s your evidence that theres no fake stiiizys in the states you listed?,2022年9
5628,"there’s no point in trying to converse with you here. this all started when you said “I think x is x but I could be wrong” I came in to say in fact you were wrong, nothing wrong w that just trynna clear up information and you say that you already said that ?? you’re just looking to argue here lol. cheers🤙🏼",2022年9
5629,i asked you to provide evidence for what you’re saying if im so wrong? i was speaking about my state specifically not in general so everything i said is true in california if you cant provide the proof to actually prove me wrong thats all you had to say,2022年9
5630,"i’ve been on this sub, the fake carts sub, and stiiizy legit check sub for almost 3 years(and seen damn near every post). not one fake stiiizy has every been posted from any state but california. you can even check all those chinese websites (alibaba, dhagte, etc) that sell fake carts/stiiizys, they will all be marked for cali. if you can link me one fake stiiizy not from california i’ll correct myself. until then, I haven’t seen it in 3 years and stiiizy only recently expanded to AZ and NV within that time. 

I’ve been buying stiiizys since they came out in 2017 in cali and followed them closely since. i’m extremely familiar and knowledgeable on this subject. this isn’t to come off as condescending or anything, it’s just annoying at this point",2022年9
5631,i personally would not take anything said or posted on reddit as fact or evidence there is so much misinformation spread online which is why i asked for you to provide some sort of anything to back up what youre saying but i still appreciate your input and just because something is marketed for california doesnt mean they cant ship it to a different address people can even ship from cali to other states not everything illegal is posted online so you cant just post a picture of a fake stiiizy and say yes heres my proof that theres a fake stiiizy in this state… it doesnt really mean or prove anything im confident that you are knowledgeable about this subject but just because you havent seen something doesnt mean it doesn’t exist. either way im not trying to argue with you despite what you might think simply trying to have a civil conversation which is what reddit is for i cant really do anything about the fact that you find it annoying to have to back up your info if you cant back it up or simply dont want to because it’s annoying i would suggest you just dont say anything at all but hey i dont like telling people what to do just a suggestion i hope we can just leave it at that cause again im not trying to argue but i dont mind going back and forth to have a civil conversation on disagreements im not sorry that you find that annoying,2022年9
5632,"jeez🤦‍♂️when I say marked for california it means in a CA! marked box. you can send that wherever you want, it’s still gonna have the CA! on the box.

lol, where’s any proof for your claims ?? I told you i’ve seen damn near ever single post on all major cart subs for the last 3 years. all the fake stiiizys posted have been CA! marked boxes. never one from another state. all of the ones available for sale online from the major fake cart sellers are all CA! marked boxes. go prove me wrong, find one fake that’s not a california marked box. I told you if you can i will correct myself and apologize. if you can’t prove they exist and there’s now evidence to support they do, why would you assume they exist? and it’s not like you’ve done any research on this clearly so why are you trynna speak on something you don’t fully know/understand ? THAT is what is annoying me lmao",2022年9
5633,"i see what you’re saying now i apologize i misread marked for marketed. the CA! sticker isnt even something i thought about ill admit that part, but here is what i do know in states wheres stiiizys arent sold legally people in other states will have people send them packaging and pods (full or empty, real or fake) from california. i know this because i have a friend in Oregon that does exactly that. im not gonna provide proof of that simply because im not gonna out that person for illegal activity so its up to you if you want to take my word for it or not but i will admit you are right about a lot of them being extremely prevalent in california but they do exist in other states even if they are marked for california im not gonna go do whole bunch of research on stickers from other states cause it honestly just doesnt matter to me that much but i do believe you when you say they are almost never seen from other states but they can be faked in california and shipped out to other states. especially in states where stiiizy isnt sold in shops people dont really care that it says CA! nor do they do know as much as we know since we are in a state that has so many resources for stiiizy we get more exposure to them. and again not everything is posted on reddit so just because you’ve been on a subreddit for 3 years doesnt mean you’ve seen every fake product to ever exist in every state, just because it not on reddit doesnt mean it doesn’t exist i personally think thats a silly excuse to say thats how you know they don’t exist my point wasn’t about the stickers being accurate to what state the fake product is actually in, just that they do exist in other states.",2022年9
5634,"yes I agree 100% that ppl send product out from cali on the regular(real and fake). i’ve seen pics of smoke shops all the way in NY with CA! marked product. but that’s my point it’s always cali marked stuff, legit never seen one from any other state. yea they could be out there but the odds of that with nobody posting abt them or being available on any of the major fake cart mfg sites is incredibly unlikely. everybody wants to buy weed from “cali” no one want to buy a product from arizona (or any other random state) which is why counterfeit california product is so prevalent compared to other states. 

side note: every state has their own unique warning symbol (except for like 2 that share one). the CA! is exclusive to cali and required for all cali product. if there isn’t one on the front, it’s not a legit product from cali. OP’s being from NV or AZ doesn’t require a warning symbol on the front hence why it’s missing. 

sorry for the rant but seems like this was a productive convo. a bit of miscommunication at the start but it seems cleared up now. cheers, have a good rest of your day 🤙🏼",2022年9
5635,glad we were able to clear up the misunderstanding and youre 100% correct when you say people want shit from cali and i will admit being in a state that has fairly loose marijuana laws i forget that not everyone lives in california truly a shame that most of the country doesn’t have direct access to a lot of stuff we have my grandpa lives in new york and he’ll send us money to have us ship wax to him hope you have a great day as well,2022年9

5661,Enter the code on the actual website. How many times did it say verified? Did it give you a date and time it was 1st scanned?,2022年9
5662,Yes! I purchased from a second market a year or so ago and thought they were legit til I scanned. Then I showed verified 100’s of times and realized they weren’t legit at all! Stay away from fake stiiizys,2022年9

5709,Or a living wage where the workers don’t have to rely on tips.,2022年9
5710,"You should. Or be getting a ""living wage"" as a bud tendor. Jobs like these are suppose to help you get your foot in the job world and get experience in customer service or sales. That way you can go to another company that offers the "" living wage"". In California EVERYTHING is going up in prices. Go to school. Get a degree and make that money.  If I'm understanding this correctly. Most likely the location we are probably talking about is San Bernardino. I know because I got the call for A/c hvac. And they have A/C. It just went out. That was it. Next thing you could have done instead of walking out is bring ice water to work.",2022年9
5711,"These things can be regional, apparently they have stores in Cali and Michigan and Cali has more worker protections.

5714,"Yeah and thats welding bro.
Imagine you probably get what 25-40 an hour ? Compared to these people getting 17-19. 
You signed a contract understanding the risks of welding and that if you are injured then you only get 6 months of paid leave and then they drop you from the insurance.
My friend mikey had a heavy metal fall on him and land on his neck on his welding job. His work isnt paying him out and only helped him for 6 months. Hes now paralyzed from the waste down and has to rely on government money because his welding job had risks he took to make 32 an hour and its to much money to sue when you havent worked for months. 

Honestly it just sounds like you are only in the welding job for money. And not for your own personal health. So go ahead and literally fry yourself because no one but you gives a single shit about how you got yourself into a high risk job for high pay. 
Osha standards regard anything above 95 degrees as unsafe working conditions. So you played yourself buddy

5718,"We walk 4-9 miles a day because i serve 50-90 customers just me alone.  And in those humid hot conditions the product not only does get moldy. But our union considers these unsafe conditions.
And my store alone served 13000 customers in one week alone. We are in the middle of the ghetto and we do not even have our own parking on the site of the store. Ive almost been hit almost 3 times each month by a car.  So i don't think you have any fucking clue what you are talking about lmao.
Also there's no proper ventilation and its extremely dusty and can easily develop mold in the vents because we already had a problem with leaks during rain. 

But dont be a dick about a growing industry and a brand that aims to ""pioneer"" this field when they obviously can do better. 

Just because you want to risk your own health working over 100 degree conditions doesn't mean everyone else will. In california they do not force construction workers to work under this cali heat and most construction is done over night through 9pm-5 am. 

All i hear from construction workers and people who work with cars in this thread is that they dont care what conditions they work in as long as it pays enough. Anybody is willing to risk their bodies health.

Your body determines your industry. And if you are willing to make sacrifices for your health. Go for it.",2022年9

Your insider isnt real. I didnt work at the san Bernardino store DUMB ASS. Still with the company. 

Stealing at stiiizy is super common than you think. Happens like twice a year. More people get fired for either attendance but lately it has been unlawful.  But the SB store fired 16 people at once. 
L.a store has sexism and favoritism, pomona store has the highest turn over rate in the state. Lost 30 employees in almost 3 months. 
Pomona store also has a coke problem
Jurupa valley store has people people doing hard drugs outside. And people setting cars on fires. And they found a dead body literally outside the store. 

New district manager got hired from a GM position and is now super friendly with the union rep and buying him shit to get him on stiiizy side instead of employees.

5722,I went to school for weed. I bud tend as a medical expert. People would come talk to me for 30 minutes to almost an hour about product and the effects because they wanted a doctor experience. Some would tip. Most would not. I can get 3 customers in 30 minutes. And maybe 1 would tip 3 bucks. If you are in and out and already know what you want. We dont care if you dont tip. But if you asking me to pull out 8 jars or more of weed and ask me for the crosses and the effects. Imma expedt a tip. Most budtender tell you the wrong effects because they want you in and out. Not me boss man. Respect your opinion. But im a server and a bud tender working two jobs. So thats my 2 cents. Smoke smoke some boof stiiizy to make you feel better,2023年6
5723,They only hire attractive people under 28. Sorry you arent qualified,2022年10
5724,Don't they start people at like $20+/hr? Seems reasonable for a budtender to me....,2022年9
5725,No way 💀. One is a health and safety violation the other is thinking you should get rich off of being a weed cashier 💀,2022年9
5726,Idk if it’s San Bernardino because it seems cool in there and no problems from budtenders I’ve talked to. On top of that there’s warehouse workers down the street unloading boxes inside 53 foot metal trailers in the sun and it’s going alright.,2022年9

5798,"If your the first scan. On the official website from stiiizy. Your good. Also the sticker where it tells you the thc amount. There should be another sticker behind that. If there is. Most likely it's legit. If your from California and bought it from the stiiizy store, most definitely your good. If you got it from "" your plug"" most chances are they're fake.

5804,Looks about like the ones i got too. If you're the first scan youre good.,2022年8
5805,"Never had a positive experience with the littles. The battery has always run out before the pod itself. If it's not hitting, all you can do it throw it or try and salvage the oil. 

You're better off getting  .5 gms and an actual battery.",2022年8
5806,"Hey bro it’s complicated ngl 

I once used a lighter on the sides the pod until I see everything runny/luquidy I then grab wire cutters I popped open an empty stiizy pod and slowly dripped it in there, you should do the same since the battery is unchargable. 

Or redneck it and rip up a usb android charger and strip the black and red wire and attach them to the -/+ under the pod and it’ll burn",2022年8
5807,"Uhh, you can’t. You can maybe salvage the pod I’ve seen it done before but it will take a lot of effort especially transferring the oil to a useable pod…",2022年8

5835,I believe this is caused by too high THC and too low CBD in modern cannabis. I personally don’t like cbd pods because they taste a bit artificial. I’d recommend asking your dispo for the lowest thc and highest cbd flower they have (>1%). Also  excercise and bring anxiety levels down regardless of weed. Or honestly quit if it happens often.,2022年9
5836,Yeah I have OG skywalker walker inidica pod. 90% thc. I don't do sativa or hybrids bcuz of that reason. I want to control my anxiety. Not induce it.,2022年8

Og pods are great if you want a cheap vape high but it's 100% placebo if you feel differences in og "" strains "".

For instance Skywalker og and blue dream are literally the same but with different synthetic flavorings. Everything eles is just marketing. 

If you go a step up into the cdt then you will get a more strain specific high due to the re introduction of terpines.

So why I don't doubt you feel a difference, it's merely a placebo effect. It's not chemically possible to really feel a differences as it is the same stripped down compounds in each vape.

If you think I'm wrong then I encourage you to look ot up on other sub reddits, online or even call them yourself.",2022年8

5878,It tastes more fruity than minty imo,2022年8
5879,Same here it was a pleasant surprise. I like the taste of CDTs better but the LR high is much better so far,2022年8
5880,"The different is the extraction method. The method that results in the distillate in og stiiizy pods has basically just only thc.

With live resin you flash freeze the plant right after you cut it from the soil. Basically you’re getting the essence of the “live” plant. Which is where the name comes from. The low temperature preserves all of the nice terps and Cannabinoids which is why those pods are so gas. I have a garlic mintz one I’m chief on right this second

Solventless is where you dont use butane or anything to extract it it’s a little like putting a nug between two hot plates and then sticking that into a pod. Have yet to try one yet",2022年8
5881,"Watermelon z and skywalker are their basic model distillate pods, this is live resin pods",2022年8
5882,Got it on sale for 50$,2022年8
5883,This right here!!,2022年8

5891,Oh ok. Well I do t do blinkers. I micro dose so we're good lol,2022年8
5892,Lol lol lol lol lol that’s was funny. I laughed out LOUD!!!,2022年8
5893,Anything CDT is so fire lol. Super clean high,2022年8
5894,my boy got the golden stickkk!! ⏸⏸,2022年8
5895,"i wasn’t too much of a fan of this flavor, it seemed a bit light compared to other CDT pods",2022年8
5896,This is my first time tryna CDT it taste similar to live resin carts,2022年8
5897,You mean like your high was going away fast bc that’s what I’m feeling I’m only faded for about 30mins then it goes away,2022年8
5898,Yup it got dat earthy taste to it. The high is so much cleaner then the regular thc dissilate pods they got.,2022年8
5899,"ahh i mean flavor wise, it’s was more bland to me than other pods. the high to me was overall good though like any other CDT",2022年8
5900,Facts I hella realized that too,2022年8
5901,"Umm on than, ima have to cheef this shit then bc I’ve been taking baby hits",2022年8
5902,The blue ones you have to wait at least 5 min between hits or you’ll burn the oil. Read the instructions lol,2022年8
5903,What are the blue packs,2022年8
5904,Beautiful collection,2022年8
5905,Curious as to what you pay per unit.,2022年9
5906,how the hell did u afford it! I envy you :O  What dispensary you go to? That much would cost me like 560$. seeing here they are like 40$ a half gram and like 50$ a full. DTLA is where I go,2022年9
5907,But doesn't one hit get you super high? Compared to the others.,2022年8
5908,yep i saw lol still haven’t tried them yet but u def gotta be careful,2022年8
5909,Oh my god I’m a fucking idiot :((,2022年8
5910,they are half gram rosin pods :) so solventless   and like the comment above^ u gotta use the small battery it burns a lot easier,2022年8
5911,"lol just very fortunate for my situation, and it was my first time at this location (i think somewhere near monterrey?) so i got a shit ton of discounts anwyays",2022年9
5912,"I have a high tolerance, I also got through a 1 gram pod every 3-4 days",2022年8
5913,maybe?? i love stiiizy especially their cdt pods but it’s my first time buying the rosin pods,2022年8
5914,"Rosin and Live resin pods are hard to find in Phx,Arizona. The small battery is best for anything tbh. Big one is overkill or gotta hit it for 1 second 3 times let it cool down",2022年8
5915,"i love the big batt tho tbh    and yea im sure it is, i just got lucky bc i was in cali for the week!!",2022年8
5916,What did you pay? The cdt pods we have are 80$ with no medcard. That's like 30% tax included. 72 for a normal gram,2022年8
5917,"to be honest i do not remember what i paid but i know it was not that much for all them, i also got a bunch of first time discounts at that store    also a few other grams of rosin so it changed my total i spent less than 800 all in all",2022年8
5918,"It is not illegal without pods, it is just a vape battery on its own.",2022年8
5919,"scientifically speaking terpenes have absolutely 0 effect on your bodies cannabinoid system or effect your high in any way. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109307/

cannabinoids on the other hand have proven effects on your cannabinoid system so they will make your high feel different. 

CBG and THCv are known minor cannabinoids that cause uplifting effects and make you feel ""energetic"". 

the skywalker batch you have probably has a good bit of CBG or THCv or both.",2022年8
5920,Fuckkkkk yes they do,2022年8
5921,"Yes. If you look on the back lower bottom it tells you how much THC and CBD it has. So the more THC the more high, hence the different highs😛",2022年8
5922,Didnt even know that thanks,2022年8
5923,Is this a disposable?,2022年8
5924,I had to call Stiiizys Downtown LA building to verify these were new flavors as the site isn’t even updated yet!,2022年8
5925,Picked up their set of new CDT strains from the DTLa shop a couple weeks ago. My fave of the batch is Jealousy. All are 🔥 tho,2022年8
5926,the cdt pods and the solventless pods are my absolute favorite 😍,2022年8
5927,"Im not sure if stiiizy ever brings back the older cdt strains they had. I tried some last year that I don't see or find anymore, so in a way the cdt strains they have are always ""new"".",2022年8
5928,have jealousy currently ! super good!! but this white guava sounds amazing 😵‍💫😵‍💫,2022年8
5929,Dang I wish I grab this instead of jealousy! 😭😩,2022年8
5930,I tried Limoncello it was fire!,2022年8
5931,Hell yes I can’t wait to try me the Jealousy! This white guava is fucking amazing though!,2022年8
5932,"I seem to have been able to track down just about every single one that’s listed on the stiiizy website, except for maybe 4 of them. But yea they haven’t really released any new CDT flavors for a while to the best of my knowledge. 

Like I said these aren’t even listed on Stiiizys official website yet lol! 

Can’t wait to try the other two new flavors Limoncello and then the Jealousy one next. They are extremely hard to get ahold of any of these 3 right now I was very very lucky to get this one.",2022年8
5933,Damn homie how’s the jealousy? Is it more Indica or more sativa of a hybrid would u say?,2022年8
5934,It’s all good this one is no doubt amazing but I can’t wait to try jealousy too.,2022年8
5935,super good! smells super good and the taste is definitely there and earthy 😊,2022年8
5936,How’s the taste bro ? I just copped it off Weedmaps it’s coming tmr 💪🏼💪🏼,2022年10
5937,"def a hybrid, not too heavy like a indica",2022年8
5938,Hell yea I will be grabbing a jealousy and Limincello by the end of this week to taste them but I swear I’ll be getting like at least 5 more white guavas.,2022年8
5939,The wattage is higher on the big and makes the pods hit bigger but i cant say i use my big bat a ton as if you use it too much it will easily burn a pod,2022年8
5940,the biiig is just bigger clouds and longer batt life. the down side of the biiigs is that it fucks up the flavor. you could be halfway through a pod and it state like burnt coils but it’s mostly personal preference. i personally like the the regular batts more. Mostly cuz it doesn’t burn my pod and the flavor lasts longer,2022年8
5941,Battery life longer that's all.,2022年8
5942,I pretty much only use the Biiig battery and have little to no issues. Hits harder then the other.,2022年8
5943,I switched from the big battery to the small one because it kept burning my pods,2022年8
5944,"Barely any upsides compared to the starter kit battery imo. More battery life is literally the only positive. Running at a higher voltage for bigger hits/clouds just wastes your oil faster. On top of that, it's bigger and takes up more space. Not as stealthy as the smaller battery obviously. 

Maybe someone with a biig battery can enlighten me because I don't see the point in ""upgrading""",2022年8
5945,"in my opinion, its not worth it because I keep hearing about how fragile those batteries are, and they burn thru ur pods faster. the only pro is longer battery life",2022年8
5946,I have two of each. I definitely prefer the small ones like the majority. IMO the portable charging kit is a must for the small battery if you are going to be out all day.,2022年8
5947,[deleted],2022年8
5948,"I’ll say this they’re all distillate and will literally affect you the same way. The taste will vary, Anything else you feel is placebo. CDT & Live Resin on the other hand, will give you a more true, flower high and taste. The smaller THC % leaves more room for actual terpenes that get you way more faded off a “smaller percent”",2022年8
5949,"Pretty damn gas , taste is on point , and the potency is there Fs",2022年8
5950,So good that I can't tell you cause I was so high,2022年8
5951,"Not not sure why skywalker og is so hyped, but all my stiiizy products I defend with much pride. I used to be like “I’ve gotta buy a separate, non ubiquitous, battery for this shit?” Finally got an e-nail with a 510 adapter and a pod adapter that still didn’t fit the stiiizy pods so I caved and bought the battery. However, they give them away quite frequently now at my dispo, so I have a few now in different colors, but honestly I’m sure slywalker is gonna turn you to the dark side, so get lit off blinkers yo. Vape responsibly.",2022年8
5952,"Just hit mine- love it, it’s one of my fave indica pods. Great for my anxiety but I can still be productive if need be. I like the taste, too- so glad it’s not flavored. 

I will say, it does make my friend’s anxiety worse, or so he says. Just start slow until you know how it hits ya.",2022年8
5953,A good reliable brand… I recommend Skywalker for sure!,2022年8
5954,Honestly I had skywalker maybe 2x only and honestly it my favorite like the high is there yeah but eh taste wasn’t for me . I would suggest strawanna pod it’s hella fire in taste super tasty and flavorful and it for fire will mellow you out it’s a creeeper so careful one moment u good then u start feeling it . I love it,2022年8
5955,Well I'm not looking to get FUCKED up. I'm looking to mellow out for my anxiety. And be calm and chill.,2022年8
5956,[deleted],2022年8
5957,Lol,2022年8
5958,White raspberry (indica) is the way to go 100%,2022年8
5959,"lol, just calculate your hits. You literally can grab the strongest/weakest just take hit by hit.",2022年8
5960,"If you hit it right , it won’t fuck you up like that but it IS potent .",2022年8
5961,"Give strawnana a try too. Idk about others but it mellos me out nicely. Especially after i play some league, i definitely need it after each game",2022年8
5962,Then you should try the mango with cbd,2022年8
5963,How was it? I just got it and I’m not trying to get fucked up either lol,2022年9
5964,"Not hating, we just started at this and stiiizy’s proprietary battery pod system was 10/10. I just think they need to adjust with the times and price live resin to where they should be priced. In the years they’ve been out live resin has gotten so cheap to manufacture it should be priced with the competition. The distillate pods all tasted good, we just are graced now with so much more, we have the choice to get a better, more natural high",2022年8
5965,🔥,2022年8
5966,I was looking into the mango cbd 1:1 but I thought that was a sativa with cbd. I don't do well with sativa. It induces my anxiety even more.,2022年8
5967,"This happened with my first biiig battery two years ago. It still worked fine even after the shell was off, but was sometimes inconvenient when the shell came off on its own.",2022年8
5968,Did you get it from the STIIIZY store. If you did they got a 7 day return policy. If not. Possible you might got a fake one and I tried to get my money back.,2022年8
5969,happened to me too. i just used a little bit of superglue on the outside of the black part of both sides and then slide it up and just hold it there for like a minute and boom. brand new hehe.,2022年8
5970,This has been a known issue with allloooot of the stiiizys biiig batteries.,2022年8
5971,"Happened to my first biiig battery, honestly would just slide it back together bc it worked fine.",2022年8
5972,Lol this happened to my boyfriends biigy 😭 I dunno tape it maybe,2022年8
5973,"Just super glue it in, wait for it to fully dry so you don’t inhale any fumes",2022年8
5974,"I want to love this but after about a week of owning, our biiig battery separated like this and now it always wants to come undone. Does anyone else have this experience? Are they working to revise this design? Anyone having better luck with the smaller version? Any input is appreciated.",2022年8
5975,I got 2 regular batteries and 2 big batteries and no issues. You must have just gotten a bad one.,2022年8
5976,Just put a piece of electrical tape at the bottom . You’ll be good .,2022年8
5977,"happened to me too after a couple of months. the battery gets too hot either from the battery heating up itself or the heat outside, and the glue melts. should still work, but if u pull it out too much it starts to break like in my case. the little stiiizy’s don’t have this problem, but if you keep the big’s cool they should be fine for a bit too",2022年8
5978,Same bro both my big battery’s are falling apart like this. going back to the stick battery. It rips and doesn’t fall apart. Oh well hopefully stiiizy fixes that issue.,2022年8
5979,"I ordered from Stiiizy months ago and it fell apart soon after. I’ve just been dealing, but wanted to know if the issue has been addressed. Don’t want to pick up another if it’s going to happen again.",2022年8
5980,"It does work relatively fine still, although it is terribly irritating as it starts to slide apart at each use. I was seeking input on whether the other models (like the Liiil) suffered from this as I do like their system and cartridges, but am not overly fond of the issue. Really hoping they work to fix this in future models. A simple screw could have gone a long way to making this non-issue.",2022年8
5981,I would have just went with the skinny one. Those always slap. Or get the disposable ones.,2022年8
5982,"Wait so this one is from stiiizy direct? A shop around me has fake ones (I suspect) because this happens to them when pulling out the charger. 

The ones I've gotten at stiiizy have never done this.",2022年8
5983,"That’s what I was kinda feeling out. If the skinny is a bit more robust, it might be a good move for me.",2022年8
5984,This was from Stiiizy directly. Happened with just typical use and didn’t take long after we got it.,2022年8
5985,Yeah bcuz I just picked up my skinny one last weekend. And it's doing the job. I mean it's compact and able to be discreet if you out in public. One or two hits of my OG skywalker. And I'm chillin. So might want to check it out.,2022年8
5986,naw stick to big stiiizy. this is a ez fix fr fr !,2022年8
5987,Dabcap works with stiiizy promise,2022年8
5988,G Pen makes one for the Gio that I guarantee will fit I’ve got both systems and it’s like 10 bucks def worth a shot,2022年8
5989,Have been in your shoes,2022年8
5990,I second this,2022年8
5991,"Thanks! They look to be out of stock, but I signed up for an alert when it's back.",2022年8
5992,Wtf bro shit is from the dispo? That’s weird lol you should take that shit back it’s defective most dispensary have a 7 day refund brother !,2022年8
5993,What flavor is it? I’ve had that happen to at least 4 of my blue burst pods before I stopped purchasing that flavor since I’ve have other friends of mine say the same about blue burst.,2022年8
5994,"You have to keep stiiizy pods upright 247 enless they do this and get clogged as well, Keep them in a jar. You can try pulling and inhaling to break the wax in the mouth piece.",2022年8
5995,"Return it, it’s a defective product",2022年8
5996,Try slightly heating it up with a lighter and tilt it so the wax can move or I think it’s the little cover that’s under the mouth piece that isn’t covering the two side holes take the mouth piece of and check bro,2022年8
5997,Call their support. They are pretty good at replacing defected carts,2022年8
5998,:( that pod died you should get a refund,2022年8
5999,Did you charge it with the pod inside?,2022年8
6000,Damn never seen that happen try to return it,2022年8
6001,You leaving it in the car? In your pocket outside in the heat? Only time that happens to me is when I forget my Stiiizy in the car and the heat ruins it,2022年8
6002,blue burst always,2022年8
6003,It was the blue sunrise or something,2022年8
6004,^^,2022年8
6005,Nope,2022年8
6006,"Nah, it was in my house the whole time at room temp",2022年8
6007,"Ohhh, try to get a refund and never get that flavor again. It’s definitely a manufacturer problem and it’s best to just stay away from it so you’re not wasting your money.",2022年8
6008,Happened to me once after I did that guess it got too hot idk,2022年8
6009,"Definitely defected then. 
They tell you that you have a week to return any defected ones with the receipt.

If you're being honest and it's defected(which it is), just buy a new one, save the receipt and then put the old one in the new packaging. 
return that bs.",2022年8
6010,Get one full. They last longer than two individual ones,2022年8
6011,"Welcome to stiiizy world 😂. I’d get one full. Use the regular stiiizy battery not the biiig battery, biiig battery burns oil faster",2022年8
6012,"no danger in doing that but make sure NOT to add a lot of wax to your flower, too much and you’ll be stuck to your couch for hours! 

have fun🍃

if you do have a glass piece, you can also pack a bowl and add a little drop of the distillate on top",2022年8

Well that was 120 down the drain😭😭😭 i need to find someone who back doors lol",2022年8

6020,if you enter the code on the official website it says invalid,2022年8

6022,What state are u in that ur getting taxed $120 for both FG pods lmao.,2022年8
6023,that doesn't mean anything when on the official website it says the code is invalid for both. when you scan it it brings you to a fake website,2022年8
6024,that sticker with the pod name look effy imo,2022年8

6030,What street was it on? I haven’t seen anything posted about it yet but that would definitely be cool to have one closer to the valley,2022年8
6031,"Yeah! its next to a gas station. its called ""Stiizy Pacoima"" I was there on opening day and got a giant stiiizy bong, 1st 100 customers",2022年9

6066,Vaping in general isn’t healthy.,2022年8

I started to make sure I always had a drink besides water (tea, hot coco, iced tea, juice). And air purifier in your room helps a ton.",2022年8

6069,Yeah it might be that you are just sick and don't know it I got sick a couple weeks back and everything felt rough even my bong hits still took the bong hits helps me take out all the mucus,2022年8
6070,vaping constantly everyday isn’t healthy it dries out your throat which is why you have to stay hydrated or you’ll feel like this,2022年9
6071,Smoking anything for 9 months isn't good,2022年8
6072,Do you share carts? Maybe you caught strep throat or something 🤷‍♂️,2022年8
6073,"Probably just sick. I got a cough and it’s been almost a month, just starting to go away now.",2022年8
6074,Pretty sure I’m not sick but idk. I guess we’ll see.,2022年8
6075,Nah. No cart sharing. I stopped smoking the stiiizy for the past 2 days and my throat is recovering.,2022年8
6076,Well I guess you got to the point to just smoke buds,2022年8
6077,"I’ve had the throat problem before, but wasn’t related to stiiiz, but my cheating ex. ThTs why sharing came to mind. To be honest I have never had any problems with stiiizy carts.",2022年8
6078,So I stopped the stiiizy for the past 2 days and decided to smoke bud and my throat issue went away.,2022年8
6079,I smoke bud in the morning and when I get home but during work I jist hit the stiiizy twice and thats it,2022年8

6086,"yes, it can rub off pretty easily or fade with use",2022年8
6087,Then you can call it a tobacco vape at the airport you’re welcome,2022年8
6088,Yes,2022年8
6089,Yes it rubs off,2022年8
6090,"Yessir, rubs off fairly easily.",2022年8
6091,Yes,2022年8
6092,Yeah man they rub off easily,2022年8
6093,Yep very easy,2022年8
6094,yes! i wipe mine off!,2022年8
6095,I buy mine from a Stiizy store and have never had one rub off. I’m trying to scrape it off with my fingernail and it’s not coming off. I don’t know how ya’ll are doing it.,2022年8
6096,mine comes off cuz of chapstick lol but yes they do fade overtime,2022年8
6097,"im not familiar with the CA pods, but from what i've seen it looks like it can rub off after like your first hit",2022年8
6098,yup kinda wished it last longer though,2022年8
6099,Lmao they dont check??,2022年8

6105,orange sunset is so good. sometimes it hits me hard and makes me think it’s indica lol,2022年8
6106,"It's probably my favorite atm, it gives off a good high",2022年8
6107,good question,2022年8
6108,I go back and forth between regular Stiiizy pods and say another brand like Raw Garden bc sometimes I feel like Stiiizy carts can be a bit too thick 🤔,2022年8
6109,Subjective. Plus since it’s distillate technically it’s no different high wise from the other ‘strains’.. more like flavor instead of strain with distillate.,2022年8
6110,Doesn't matter,2022年8
6111,Lol,2022年8

6141,If you want a mix of sativa and indica which is a hybrid I suggest getting strawnana it taste fucking amazing and the high is up there 🤘🏻. But if you’re going to Dtla stiiizy maybe try getting the deal they have for the pods I know it’s 5 half gram pods of the og line for $100 or 5 full gram OG pod for $200 . Just a little tip to save you some cash,2022年8

6182,Michigan with med card - whole camo setup with 1 g card. 50 with 6 percent tax. I often see 6/100 for 1g pods at bigger names dispensaries,2022年8
6183,That probably because they just opened it in Michigan and will raise the prices once everyone's on them,2022年8
6184,Huh? No they won’t stiiizy is already way overpriced compared to the rest of their stuff a cart/pod LR 1g in Michigan is like $40 for the best without any deals a normal dist pod from stiiizy is about $40 as well they gotta come down in price to match the market here then charge this,2022年8

6228,The bubbles? I get that from my carts when it’s hit it too many times in a row.,2022年8
6229,Depends which battery your using. Seems like it with the biiig battery honestly,2022年8
6230,I have the standard stiiizy battery (basic one on their site) and I've been smoking them for the last six months - I've never had a cart start hitting more harshly as it's depleted - even all the way down to a completely empty pod,2022年8

6237,Let me know how those cdts are! Trying them today after work but my nearest menu has only half grams.,2022年8
6238,Cdts are my go to. I prefer these over the live resin and it the og. I feel like these hit harder imo. Yeah definitely get the full gram they last longer,2022年8
6239,I feel the same way. What location did you hit? The ones I've gone to only ever have the lemon flavor or white durban.( I don't like indica).,2022年8

6256,If only we could all be so lucky. Some of us are stuck down in NC.,2022年8
6257,"Agreed, I'm happy with the White Fire. I was surprised it was labeled as a straight Indica on the box since on the menu it was labeled as a Hybrid, but like you said it has some uplift to it as well so there def is a good balance. 

White Fire during the day, GMO Cookies after the sun goes down!",2022年8
6258,"Agreed. Made the mistake of getting the OG Kush ""Rainbow Flavor"" pod last time, because on the menu it was only listed as OG Kush and didn't mention any rainbow.. Tasted weird as one would imagine cuz I mean wtf is ""rainbow flavor"" anyways..",2022年8
6259,these are Michigan stiiizys. that is MI’s cannabis warning symbol,2022年8
6260,"Mostly indica just because my nervous system tends to already be overactive as it is, and sativas just add fuel to that fire (anxiety, sweating, stomachaches, etc)! 

I usually go for a balanced hybrid or indica-leaning hybrid throughout the day, then heavy straight indica at night for sleep. 

Smoked flower for 15 years and whenever i tried cartridges I always thought they tasted like poison and my lungs were sending off red flags that it just wasn't good/clean stuff. But Stiiizy is legit, I only recently started using them and am a fam of the Cannabis Derived Terpene pods specifically versus the botannical terpene pods.",2022年8

6311,I was wondering if they even made CBD pods.. my wife could use for debilitating injury.. glad to see they do! But obviously must be hard to come by  thanks for posting though! 👍,2022年8
6312,"really starting to see more people want these, maybe @stiiizy will catch on and start making some more strain options and even some solventless cbd options🤔😂🙌",2022年8
6313,Do your pods feel loose in your biiig battery ? Got one today and tried a few pods and they feel a bit loose,2022年8
6314,Who tf is buying cbd pods?,2022年8
6315,How are they since its a 1:1 still decent amount of thc.,2022年8
6316,"Extremely relaxed. No unnecessary sedation, no energizing feeling, just relaxing.",2022年8
6317,Definitely less intense but the high is still there . I’m still able to think clearly and feel relaxed,2022年8
6318,Yeah I have a half gram in mines now and it’s loose . I think the whole gram fits better,2022年8
6319,People who don’t like to be too fried all the time,2022年8
6320,i got one yesterday i really liked it. I been dealing with some pretty bad stress induced eczema so i was looking for anything to help relieve the itching and it actually helped. I was able to think clearly as well without being too high. Its not overpowering but its super mellow and relaxing.,2023年4
6321,"Yeah, I feel you. I have both and wish they had more strains.",2022年8
6322,It’s the drip of hot oil leaking out sometimes it happens,2022年8
6323,YES! I think it's juice spatter.,2022年8
6324,Try moderating how hard you're inhaling....imagine trying to gently pull the vapor from the pod rather than inhaling hard.,2022年8
6325,"Had an entire half of a 1G pod squirt out of the cart while on vaca out of state a couple days ago. It was supposed to last me the whole trip and ended up lasting like half a day after that

Sad times. Plus that shit hurt and tastes like ass",2022年8
6326,I do hit it gently and often throughout the day. I can't do power hits anyway. However my husband hits it harder than I do and never had this happen to him.,2022年8
6327,Just had the same issue with a Pineapple Express 1g pod. Definitely kills the day.,2022年8
6328,"Strange!  Do you tend to take hits back to back?  Like right after taking one hit you take a second a few seconds after? I had to stop doing that because I was experiencing something similar to you on the 2nd of back to back hits. It's annoying but now I try and give it 45-60 seconds in between hits to ""cool off"" and have been okay so far.",2022年8
6329,Nope. Vapes make me cough so I take a hit and give it a few minutes at least in between hits. Usually it's just hitting it randomly throughout the day.,2022年8
6330,I got a couple pods the other day and today was deciding between the blue burst and the strawnana. Think ima go with strawnana first though lol. Enjoy!,2022年8
6331,"Blue burst makes me sleepy, its a nighttime strain",2022年8
6332,How much are the pods ?,2022年8
6333,Just looks amazing,2022年8
6334,Cheers 🍻,2022年8
6335,I love the green green battery! Just curious; how much are you paying for pods?,2022年8
6336,got that today!!,2022年8
6337,are these the normal pods? meaning distillate,2022年8
6338,"i love strawnana ! this is my first time w the blue burst, i like the flavor and that first hit had me so stoned",2022年8
6339,really!? for me it kind of did but not as much as some other hybrids,2022年9
6340,"usually around $60, less if you buy in bulk",2022年8
6341,They are around $40 or $45 in my area. I like blue burst but the flavor is strong. It’s supposed to be though. I prefer the CDT ones much more.,2022年8
6342,thanks !! i usually pay around 60 per full gram pod but if i buy in bulk the price goes down for 1,2022年8
6343,I just opened my strawnana. It tastes very good. This is my first time trying it. And I haven’t tried the blue burst yet either. My regular batteries are acting weird though I can’t get a decent hit so I’m going to try my biiig stiiizy,2022年8
6344,In bulk ?? What does that mean,2022年8
6345,"Oh okay , so just the pods are regularly $60 right , why so much that’s like the price of two karts . Are they that good!?",2022年8
6346,[deleted],2022年8
6347,when you buy multiple at once,2022年8
6348,"I tried these for the first time last month. Mango half gram hit me way harder than I expected (although I do have a low tolerance). Suffice to say, these 1:1 pods certainly fit the bill.",2022年8
6349,"Been looking into these. How would you say the effects are? Compared to a normal stizzzy, do these get you way way less “high”? thanks a ton!",2022年8
6350,I also suffer from anxiety as well. And I wanted to get the 1:1 pods but I was a little scared bcuz it doesn't say weather it's a sativa or indica thc with the cbd. I don't do well with sativa. It makes my ancestors worse. So I just bought OG skywalker and im micro dosing that. Like one 2 second hit and im feeling it and im done. But I want something that'll help me function through out the day and get back to my normal base   What else can you tell me about these 1:1. Is it sativa or indica with the cbd. Any info will help out ALOT.,2022年8
6351,"I am so content with them. These are my 3rd round of them. I just love that they don’t have me so high I can’t function around normal people.
I guess I feel like I have more control over my high with these tbh",2022年8
6352,"I feel like I’m not one to smoke weed to help a headache because I feel like the dehydration from vaping/smoking just makes it worse so I never do. This seems to help with my chronic muscle pain in my shoulder remarkably and I can smoke a fair amount to help with that but at the same time I’m not like laid out- I’m still highly functioning.
I get really nervous in public situations but my husband indulges I’m very public things so I’m able to cope better with engagement because my anxiety and nervousness is decreased. I focus more (defiantly what I would vape and drive with) but at the same time I like just chillin and watching movies while feeling lifted off these too. I donno I’ve never been a huge advocate for cbd because it’s never really done me any justice in comparison to all the hype others bring to cbd but this was some of the first pods that I actually loved the benefits from. The mango has always been my favorite.
They are just perfect for me and my high functioning and active life style.
That reminds me to- HIKING. Such a good one for the hikes with out wasting away on my stamina 👍🏼",2022年8
6353,That’s a great way to describe the high. I feel the same way about it.,2022年8
6354,"I greatly appretiate the quick response, this was very helpful, thanks so much!",2022年8
6355,Can I just say thanks for the dope vibes.. man I used to utilize Reddit so much and I loved the platform and connecting with people but recently so many people just got hella bad vibes (even in the cannabis community!) and it’s refreshing that after not posting for a long while this post I made first few hits have great vibes. ✌🏼 appreciate ya!,2022年8
6356,"Out of these 2 only tried Blue Burst but next time I take a trip I wanna try blue dream 
So far out of every flavor I tried blue burst is the best",2022年8
6357,Thats the 1st stiiizy flavor I tried. It honestly got me into stiiizy in general. Definitely in my top,2022年8
6358,"the first 15 hits of Blue burst is like a delicious blue otter pop on a summers day. Which i do love. But overall the blue dream has less of a strong flavor so easier to smoke long term. 

I admit my favorite stiiizy pods are premium jack and pineapple express which both don’t have any flavor added in",2022年8
6359,I didn’t like Pineapple Express at all,2022年8
6360,A lot of people don’t like either of them because they say they taste like weed.,2022年8
6361,How you gonna like smoking weed but not like the taste of weed,2022年8
6362,Facts wtf😭,2022年9
6363,I get mad when I hit a cart and it taste like candy personally I love the taste of weed,2022年9
6364,"Check on Etsy, even tiktok",2022年8
6365,i usually just put some small designs on them whether it’s a sticker or drawn shouldn’t be hard tbh you can find em anywhere,2022年8
6366,Bet,2022年8

6372,Same ones I been getting for a minute far as I know they real Asf any wholesale connects doe ? 😫,2022年8
6373,the fake flavored vapes are so nasty,2022年8
6374,Silver line is better,2022年8
6375,White raspberry = #1,2022年8
6376,Probably because you buy from black market dispensaries😂,2022年8
6377,"i buy from the stiiizy retailer near union station, they taste nasty and artificial",2022年8
6378,Og pods taste and feel like ass. Cdt is tolerable but I stick to live resin and solventless.,2022年8
6379,thats subjective and the purpose of the flavored ones is to taste artificial lol. there isnt weed that tastes like rainbow candy flavor or blueberries.,2022年8
6380,Yea they do the only way to go really are cdt and live resin (haven’t got my hands on a solventless blue box yet) there are a few strain specific og pods that are good none of the fruit shit will I even touch and as much as I do like true to the strain OG kush flavor the hardcore og I did not like. Sour diesel pretty good so is premium jack but like I said cdt LR is the way to go.,2022年8
6381,you did ok with the premium jack and white raspberry,2022年8
6382,Pineapple Express is one of my favorites on the pods. Premium jack grew on me as well,2022年8
6383,"agreed but in terms of regular carts, i stick with og kush, sfv og and king louis.",2022年8
6384,Yeah but king Louie is mango. I can’t do the fruit I wish there was a cdt or live res king Louie I haven’t seen one yet,2022年8
6385,nice,2022年8
6386,Also got blue burst I’m about to try next after my plug n play Girl Scout cookies.,2022年8
6387,Blue burst is sweet,2022年8
6388,probably had it upside down or on the side,2022年8
6389,Bc God intended it to,2022年8
6390,London pound cake or master kush are fire,2022年8
6391,"I liked all the gelato cdt ones but that’s a hybrid.

6399,CDT 🥇🥇🥇🥇,2022年8
6400,For Context this was my first stiiizy pod.,2022年8
6401,That’s the only pod I haven’t tried for the og pods how is it ?,2022年8
6402,"I copped it recently too. Its a high that feels sober, i am creative without the confusion. I prefer stuff like sour diesel but this is good too",2022年8
6403,It’s good. Taste is good. And the high is a nice feeling.,2022年8
6404,Pineapple Express is a must,2022年8
6405,"It’s good G but what you looking for our there Heavy Indicas Like Grand Daddy Purp and Purple Punch But my absolute Favorite Is Skywalker Og and King Louie

Edit: I also just finished trying all the Indica Strains of The regular Pods",2022年8
6406,Never had stiiizy Pineapple Express yet but I just finished plug n plays and it was amazing. Definitely give it a go for stiiizy,2022年8
6407,really piney terps,2022年8
6408,"i got pineapple express and og kush, whatd you think of the og kush ?",2022年8
6409,"yeah it was a pretty good high, definitely glad i got it!",2022年8
6410,Og kush I believe is Rainbow Flavor I liked it a lot I like the high too It just taste the worst when it gets burnt and sometimes ruin the whole flavor for the person,2022年8
6411,Same! I wish they had more 1:1 carts. I've tried cherry sunset CDT. Very much mellows me out as well,2022年8

6413,"gmo cookies, double mintz",2022年8
6414,Did it make your heart race at all? That’s why i stick to the cbd ones,2022年8
6415,hows the high?,2022年8
6416,"Haven't checked tbh, but I get your point. The 1:1 is a very different effect.",2022年8
6417,Pineapple Express has been my favorite strain since I started smoking weed. Good is an insulting understatement,2022年8
6418,Yes very earthy taste can’t go wrong with it,2022年8
6419,Haven’t had it for stiiizy yet but for other legit brands it’s good. Just finished a plug n play Pineapple Express and tasted amazing.,2022年8
6420,It’s my go-to when smoking Stiiizy.,2022年8
6421,It’s my favorite hybrid from stiiizy for sure.,2022年8
6422,Yep,2022年8
6423,"strawnana or birthday cake are two i reach for in the afternoon or when i'm being social, they keep me feeling good without getting me too tired.",2022年8
6424,Apple Mintz is usually my go to for that. It's pretty balanced and has a nice flavor as well.,2022年8
6425,some advice: stop taking blinkers ur ruining your pods by overheating the metals inside which means you’re inhaling them.,2022年8
6426,Whaaaat blinkers are bad?! I’ve never heard that. Wouldn’t they be designed to blink BEFORE they’re overheating?,2022年8
6427,I guess so but overtime it will melt the metal into the oil,2022年8
6428,some people like to take blinkers and immediately remove the pod to let it cool off,2022年8
6429,"Oooh thanks for the info! I’ll try to avoid them and I like the idea of taking the pod out to cool if I do hit a blinker. 

Just curious, what’s your source for that info? And could stiiizy have improved by now? I love blinkers because I can easily quantify them and keep an eye on my tolerance/usage. But I love my lungs more!!",2022年9
6430,"it’s kind of just general knowledge, the coils get hot and at some point the metal melts which eventually merged with the oil, but if you’re looking for a source many youtubers like Erick Khan have made videos about it",2022年9
6431,Thanks dude!,2022年9
6432,strawnana is a cdt pod?,2022年8
6433,"Depends on what you're trying to get out of it. Calming, stress relief, pain relief, etc.  Higher % doesn't always mean better. Look into terpenes for each strain and what effects they give off",2022年8

6449,Cheers mate,2022年8
6450,Tie between lemon pie and purple zkittles out of this batch,2022年8
6451,Appleberry is fire but the taste kinda sucks once you start running low,2022年8
6452,"if you look closely there’s a small qr code at the bottom right corner, try that, if it don’t work then idk",2022年8
6453,Looks fake,2022年8
6454,The qr code should be on the top right of the box,2022年8
6455,Sadly that just gives me the test serial number that you can find on actual lab sites but not with stiiizy themselves,2022年8
6456,Orange sunset 🌅,2022年8
6457,Strawnana is a fire strain. Love the taste,2022年8
6458,Strawnana is my favvvv. Just ran out this morning :(,2022年8

6460,"Strawnana, Sour Tangie, Orange Sunset.",2022年8
6461,Been smoking stiiizys for about 2 years now. Love them cuz it's discrete unlike smoking flower. My breaks at work are super chill. No smell. Wish I lived in Cali though. Went to the stiiizy store for the first time when I visited and it was really cool to see all they got. Enjoy your stiiizys!,2022年8
6462,That watermelon z just hit different. Taste real good,2022年8

6482,"+1 for strawberry cough, i also like sfv og",2022年8
6483,I love how every one here has a different answer. I say go for a solventless pod. Better than vaping distallete and live rosin tastes much better. You just have to be careful of burning it. Live rosin is basically chemical free so it's the healthiest vape option now if you can afford it and if it's available in your area. I recommend you only buy from stiiizy store too if possible or go on their website and see if the store is a legit stiiizy retailer.,2022年8
6484,"i actually just got my first stiiizy bat & pods a couple weeks ago, doublemintz, & wifi 43. the doublemintz so far is my favorite i can't wait to try more flavors. (also, recommendations anyone? getting a new haul this week)",2022年8

6492,"Enjoyed the White raspberry.. Def the bigger battery those lil ones are a waste of money 💴 
Enjoy",2022年8
6493,Do some pods have different atomizers? Cause usually the middle atomizer looks not as curvy as that one but I had one like this one the other day. Does anyone know if Stiiizy sometimes uses different hardware?,2022年8
6494,The portable charging case is a must with the small battery IMO. I prefer them personally.,2022年8
6495,"OP’s is newer hardware. stiiizy made a slight change in the rod/atomizer style

6500,Highly agree,2022年8

6502,"Agree. And if you want to save money and have that high quality Stiiizy CDT taste, go for Variety Drugs Super Lemon Haze live resin carts. I think they are actually CDT because the taste is similar, and the carts are $17 per gram at Flower Co: https://flowercompany.com/r/PXAHPQ648",2022年12

6519,They are literally all the same. Just different flavors.,2022年8
6520,i have apple fritter rn and its sooo good. its like a green jolly rancher taste on the inhale with slight weed taste on the exhale.,2022年7

6526,If yall gotta do all that just to smoke in 2022 that's sad,2022年8
6527,Not too uncommon for the pods themselves to be clogged or defective.. just take a toothpick and insert into the little blow-hole opening on the pod and half-turn and then try. Hope it works so you can enjoy your fish tacos! 🐟🌮,2022年7
6528,"It could be clogged, pull hard until it clears. Use your tongue to kinda “pulse” the suck, it helps. Also check the light, it’s only happened to me once but if it blinks a weird red and white color the pod connection is messed up and stiiizy and most dispensaries will do a return for defect pods. It does work if you hold it in a certain position.",2022年7
6529,Pods probably clogged brah,2022年7

6539,"LOL I had to check the date and make sure it wasn't 4/1.  That looks a little cumbersome I'll stick to my Biig Stiizy but, thanks for the look.",2022年8
6540,"Honestly, just got to Cali yesterday as a long time pax user and after reading all about stiiizy and plugplay I came here jazzed to get my hands on full gram pods.  So I went and bought a plugplay setup and a justjack pod yesterday along with a pax pod.  The pax experience is just far and away the better option, taste, functionality, longevity, but yes, the plugplay slaps and gets you blasted, but it tastes like ass. Plug the battery is almost 30% bigger. The poster up there talking about the “hot hitting” battery is spot on, I was gonna buy a ton of these things but now ima pass. Maybe I’ll try stiiizy.",2022年9
6541,Pnp livest is good I really think the better stiiizy LR flavors (bcuz they’re all good) are better flavor then pnp. The plug and play distillate was not good IMO it was way to artificial tasting and no natural or botanical terps are worth what they get for theirs. The strain specific distillate not the fruit flavors atleast resemble a marijuana taste.,2023年1
6542,Lmao they most definitely Don’t. But whatever floats your boat,2022年8
6543,Like stiiizy doesn’t also have a high ass voltage? Lol,2022年7
6544,Feel like they do this too so u buy their pods more often because we burn thru them fast asf compared to other 1g carts/pod system. Just a theory i have while high😂,2022年7
6545,lmao,2022年8
6546,That would be the pluuug and playyy,2023年1
6547,what it’s a plug play and stiiizy,2022年7
6548,Def try stiiizy but try their livest line it’s the live resin and they’re good but definitely worth trying before you write them off. Stick with stiiizy cdt and live resin also the solventless they’re all going to taste like weed and not artificial bullshit. Good luck.,2023年1
6549,How u know what I was coppin in 2017 😂,2022年8
6550,Idgaf what u were coppin lol😂 plugnplay is good.,2022年8
6551,"Didn’t say it wasn’t, they just taste like D8 Cakes",2022年8
6552,"While I can’t say if it’s equivalent to .2g grams, I would say if you have a low tolerance to pace yourself. The stiiizy pod is more potent than flower. So I would take small hits and wait 30 minutes in between until you reach your desired level (:",2022年8
6553,"I’ve found that wax and flower hit people differently. Personally, mid shelf flower would hit me harder than any stiiizy distillate, but I have friends that experience the opposite. Either way, I wouldn’t trip over it, you can easily control ur high with stiiizy by just taking small hits. First time I ever smoked was like a 3 second stiiizy hit and I was feeling real nice. The high is the same tho, thc is thc",2022年8
6554,Is it supposed to bubble up like that?,2022年7
6555,It bubbles up like that when you smoke too much at once,2022年7
6556,Si senor,2022年8
6557,Idk to me the small one is nice and discreet and after I heard the bigger batts burn more oil it made me wanna stick with the small one,2022年7
6558,Regular cause my biiig has disappeared in to the abyss,2022年7
6559,I only have the biiig battery so I may be a liiiiittle biased…,2022年7
6560,"Regular, biiig is my back up that always has battery lol",2022年7
6561,Biiig for home & regular for outdoors,2022年7
6562,Reg. Hate burnt pods,2022年7
6563,Regular,2022年7
6564,Regular. Big burns through the pods way too fast and depending on the strain sometimes I get waaaaaay too zooted after like 2/3 hits lol.,2022年7
6565,my boy got the stiiizy at the work site lol 🔥,2022年7
6566,I love the biiig but it’s burns my pods so quick. I keep it on hand but swap them out depending on if I want a huge rip or to be conservative.,2022年7
6567,"Although I do gotta say even though I prefer regular bat, I like biiig hits on occasion as the flavor profile is bomb af",2022年7
6568,i go with the regular because i use the portable battery case,2022年7
6569,Biiig ftw! Have the small one from the 4/20 box and don't really notice a difference. Need to do some science!,2022年7
6570,Stay with the small one I have 2 big ones and my pods just stay burning 😂,2022年7
6571,"I've tried and used both extensively and hands down I prefer the Biiig Stiiizy.  I know it uses more product, but I get the result I want in less time, LOL.  I very much prefer the Biiig over the standard size.",2022年7
6572,Regular !,2022年7
6573,Regular. Overall just looks and feels better,2022年7
6574,Regular and I use the big one to finish off my pods when they’re running low,2022年7
6575,Anyone think white raspberry taste exactly like dosidos,2022年7
6576,Biig,2022年7
6577,I need a stiiizy plug no cap in Houston,2022年8
6578,Biiig,2022年8
6579,Regular. Don’t want to waste all the terpenes in my live resin/rosin. Also tastes better and lasts more hits. If I want more I can just smoke more instead of taking bigger hits from the biiig battery.,2022年8
6580,Agreed.,2022年7
6581,Same.,2022年7
6582,"Yeah, I love me a fat rip, but I can always just chiefs more weed. Idk if I need to use 1/25th of my cart every time I rip the monster battery.",2022年7
6583,🤣 someone pocketed it !,2022年7
6584,You ever try the OG one? I started with the OG. I like the battery life and look of the biiig stiiizy but seems like it burns the oil quicker. How long does a pod last you?,2022年7
6585,Same 😂,2022年7
6586,"How come? Also a lot of people say the biiig burns the oil quicker , you think this is true?",2022年7
6587,Samee. That burnt taste is ass,2022年7
6588,"Noticed it burns too fast too. And same , I only had like a quarter pod left of og kush and both my regular batteries were dead so I used my biiig one and thank god I was home cause I got baked as shit from 4 or 5 hits.",2022年7
6589,You already know 🤣.,2022年7
6590,Pods are pricey in my area full grams anywhere from 50 to 80 depending where I get em so I try to conserve a little lol. But still use the biiig once in a while. My regular ones have some wiggle with the pods which I hate. My big ones hold the pod better.,2022年7
6591,does the oil in the biiig refill??,2022年8
6592,That and it’s you ripped quicker with the biiig,2022年7
6593,I’m tempted to buy one while they’re on sale. I always carry my reg red battery too though,2022年7
6594,You don’t think the biiig burns oil quicker ? Did you get one of those stiiizy holders in your 420 box? I want one of those lol,2022年7
6595,That’s what I noticed too and have heard a lot of people saying. I’m going to test it though. Get 2 pods the same flavor and see how long each will last with both batteries.,2022年7
6596,Yea lmk bro idk if I’m trippin but I think it do be burning,2022年7
6597,Definitely gets you higher quicker with less hits. You noticed too that it burns the oil quicker? I like the sleek size of the regular one but I love the look and light setup on the biiig stiiizy and of course the longer battery life.,2022年7
6598,I’m going to try both next and let you know lol,2022年7
6599,"I don’t use this as my only form of smoking, I only use it in a pinch or on the go so they can last me quite a while",2022年10
6600,Because I use the biiig stiiizy battery less,2022年7
6601,Its more voltage which means more power.,2022年7
6602,Ong n tha whole muthafuccin gram ruined 🤦‍♂️😤❌,2022年7
6603,Yeah I’ve noticed I have a weird sore throat too if I use the big battery but that’s only with the distillate pods. The CDT & Live Resin are always good,2022年7
6604,Yuuuupers you already know,2022年7
6605,"My carts have lasted about the same using them interchangeably . No holder, just the small battery, glass can, piece, papers, grinder lighter and cassette shaped speaker/battery pack . Yeah was so stoked with that box",2022年7
6606,"I agree 100% and with all of the vape pens out there it blends right in.  I like the higher quicker LOL now if the cartridges were cheaper, we'd have the Trinity Bigger, Cheaper, and Faster.",2022年7
6607,So you just wanna give it some use lol,2022年7
6608,I have a pckt 2 I use for carts and that’s variable voltage and even if I have it on the highest setting doesn’t seem to make the oil burn faster it’s weird.,2022年7
6609,Never had that happen yet lol. I was getting sore throats from other companies 510 carts which is why I switched to stiiizy. Super smooth hits.,2022年7
6610,I gotta try both batteries again and see if I see a difference. Nice. Kinda jealous lol,2022年7
6611,"I find it more relaxing when I can get high in the comfort of my own space, but it does kill the oil so using it at home is the best option.",2022年7
6612,[deleted],2022年8
6613,Probably growers and investors,2023年1
6614,Where’d you get that stiiizy battery holder in the back? That’s dope as hell.,2022年7

6635,"Ohh I'm sooooo sorry bro,

6636,True but why does someone need that many batteries xD ?!’i have 3 but honestly don’t even use all 3 .-.,2022年7
6637,Haha that was just an all around miscommunication 😂 all caught up now tho. Nothing on the east coast is cost effective enough and it sucks,2022年7
6638,Match the outfit 😂,2022年7
6639,🤣 very true. I have 2 regular and 2 biiig ones and really one use 2.,2022年7

6646,Is the pod live res ?,2022年7
6647,Like a sour green apple,2022年7
6648,Agreed. I’m more of a CDT connoisseur. This one is my favorite is the flavored OG pods.,2022年7
6649,I’m not to sure but I think they might have,2022年7
6650,No just distillate,2022年7
6651,Yea would’ve been great I’ve had the coldfire x lumpys apple fritter that shit was fuego,2022年7

6670,Great taste.,2022年7
6671,I’ve heard the biiig battery actually burns the solvent less oil a lot quicker which is a waste 😕. I think it says so on their website.,2022年7
6672,How they tasting ?,2022年7
6673,how’d you refill?,2022年7
6674,Strawana has a better taste.,2022年7
6675,new apple one tastes ⛽️. imo less artificial than the plugplay,2022年7

6685,Its gone bro. Sorry for your loss,2022年7
6686,I wouldn’t suggest using it at all unless your totally desperate!,2022年7
6687,bro this happened to me .. i swear pod and battery im the washer .. & it still worked i swear to god im still using the same battery til dis dayyy,2022年7
6688,"This may sound weird but I do this with my pod when it bubbles: place your pod inside your waistband against your hip. Go about your normal activities for an hour or so. Your body temp should allow the wax to settle so you can get a good rip of wax. If this does not work, then yes you will need a new pod, and unfortunately maybe even a battery too",2022年7
6689,What does the pod look like,2022年7
6690,Yeaaaa I think I’m just gonna do that. Probably not a good idea to vaporize dirt and detergent lmao,2022年7

6700,Not helpful,2022年7
6701,"You're saying I'd the url has a ""dash"" ""-"" in the link?",2022年7
6702,"Step 1: hit the pod until it’s warmed up. This makes the oil more liquid. 

Step 2: grab any used mask and rip the string off. Use this to tie around the “neck” of the pod. Make sure it’s tight on there or your pod is gonna fly out. 

Step 3: whip that shit (in a circle) 

Step 4: sit the pod upright and let the coil absorb more oil into the chamber 

Step 5: profit

*pics for reference 

Tips: a longer string will work better since longer radius = more centripetal force. Also this isn’t a trick for infinite oil. You can only do this about 3-4 times before you’re really out and start burning the coil.",2022年7

6777,"im so confused is that a new xbox with an attachable screen? then like a monitor doing something else? i only ask cuz for most bewer consoles to run proper capacity u need like a $500 tv shits nuts, id love to return mine if u found a better option. i have series X",2022年7
6778,Big baller. 😎,2022年7
6779,What kind of monitor your Xbox connected to ? Lol,2022年8
6780,yooo bro how is multiversus?? i been meaning to buy it,2022年7
6781,doublemintz on the battery & wifi 43 in the case,2022年7
6782,it's an xbox series s mounted to a g story portable monitor. you can find this on amazon. so the console is basically screwed into the monitor so just think of it as an xbox series s laptop without a keyboard,2022年7
6783,g story portable monitor made for xbox series s,2022年8
6784,"before i found out how the twitch drop thing worked i impulsively bought it. $40 for the game, in game currency, banner, etc. i really like the game like it's almost TOO fun. really good game man im enjoying what we have for the beta 

however it's had a lot of its issues. first of all, most people couldn't even play when it launched. no matter how good your connection is, there's still a handful of lag. & my biggest one of all, people are buying the standalone in game currency packs only to not get them in their account at all despite being charged for the money. i was one of these people, sent an email to support & still haven't gotten anything back yet; and if you look lots of people are having the same experience. i get that this is a beta but bruh...

do NOT buy it. if you wanna play, go on a streamers twitch stream playing MV, go afk 4 an hour & you're good. if you play & like the game enough, THEN buy cosmetic shit. hope this helps.",2022年7
6785,f me 😂 how much was the monitor and it functions to the full capacity the x/s can do??,2022年7
6786,"dude, i actually had no idea about any of that stuff, THANK YOU! i didnt even know about the twitch drops. you deadass saved me 40$ that i’m probably gonna spend on bud LMAO. enjoy brotha and thank you again",2022年7
6787,"it was around 250 & for more money you can go for a 4K option, has HDR & pretty good resolution",2022年7
6788,i hope you have fun. but yeah a batman skin is the equivalent to $20 & i kid you not there's like 2-3 small changes to the skin. people aren't liking the monetization so far... i don't blame them,2022年7
6789,"yeah that sounds kinda bs. but thats games nowadays. i really only buy skins for valorant, every other game i stay f2p",2022年7

6794,Nice. I picked up a birthday cake one the other day too. Haven’t smoked it yet though. Enjoy!,2022年7
6795,How much ?,2022年7
6796,left coast has actually been around for a while in the bay area. always been curious about them. I didn’t even know they worked on STIIIZY batteries!,2022年7
6797,wait different pods fit in stizzy?,2022年7
6798,underage kids commenting on that have never been inside a legal dispo 🤦🏻‍♂️,2022年7
6799,Chill wow this gotta be full of 16 year old burnouts lol just sharing these pods that fit my stiiizy batteries and hit so so so good with my buddies after work.,2022年7
6800,Left coast is sick before stiiizy had a local dispo and my dispo ran out of stiiizy pods I got a couple of these and they where chill,2022年7
6801,Left coast is fire but some of the terps in some of the strains taste so bad it makes it taste like a nic stick,2022年7
6802,Yo I need a plug in tampa!!!,2022年7
6803,"Don't have those in my state but that's sick that they fit on the stiiizy battery, love using the stiiizy but wish I could hit other wax companies was out of it",2022年7

6807,The disrespect,2022年7
6808,"Stiiizy batteries and pods are PATENTED Designs. This is not like twist ons where it’s universally used. 

Left coast = knockoff.",2022年7
6809,Those are knock offs.,2022年7
6810,I think I herd another brand doing the same thing it could be this brand idk but I remember people Coping stiiizy and there origal design back when they’d started me and my girl have talked about them before we said we would try just never seen any in any dispos we go to not many so not a high chance to see,2022年7
6811,"Yeah that’s what my buddy said, called it “stiiizy of the north” which I don’t fully believe cause I googled it and nothing came up but the product is great. I recommend it, very clean, clear, not headachy head high with the hybrid",2022年7
6812,makes me wish all pods fit stizzy batteries,2022年7
6813,or prolly never had a real cart for a good price just refilled stuff,2022年7
6814,How do these prices and results compare to the stiiizy pods? They look delicious!,2022年7
6815,"Thanks for the tip, I’ll look out for this and see if it happens.",2022年7
6816,[removed],2022年7
6817,Nah left coast is a legit brand sold in dispensary’s all over CA.,2022年7
6818,is evidently what u smoke if u think these are fake lol hes showing a DISPO PURCHASE of pods fitting in a DISPO CO BATTERY 🤦🏼‍♂️,2022年7
6819,"so alien labs, and all those other pod devices ALL infringe on stizzys patent and they just decided “ehhh let these companies take our patent” or u think mabey they have small aspects like the name patented etc since u know… theres pod n pod holders nearly identical to stizzy thatr actually a much high quality than them even so if they “patented podded thc” they could sue so many companies its unreal. i think u have a few details confused. (they coulda tried mabey but like a 510 twist off its a pretty universal connection method so i doubt anyone company can patent that method either, its the same idea with pods and pod holders. (granted not every will work with stizzy’s by design because sometimes they jus would rather have u buy their battery ofc which is how most are)",2022年7
6820,"OH LORD, PATENTED?? 😂😂😂 I hope you’re not actually this lame and are just trolling",2022年7
6821,What makes you think they're knock offs?,2022年7
6822,"for sure gonna try one next dispo trip, thanks for the review dawg!",2022年7
6823,"I got five pods, only one was half rest full gram and total was 187. Flavors are great and different from stiiizy but similar quality high, I recommend.",2022年7
6824,Thank you. One just can’t find quality trolling these days.,2022年7
6825,I got downvoted for saying left coast is a stiiizy knockoff and it is in fact a knock off. This is a stiiizy sub you just have a trash pod in a good battery.,2022年7
6826,"It fits in a stiiizy, it’s not an official stiiizy brand?",2022年7
6827,botanical terp’s?,2022年7
6828,nobody caresssss just leave and lemme do my trash shit and mind your lame ass business,2022年7
6829,That doesn't make it a knockoff its a legit brand,2022年7

6832,What’s solventless?,2022年7
6833,Same thing as the live resin tbh,2022年7
6834,^^,2022年7
6835,They taste the same ?,2022年10
6836,"Heat, Pressure, Ice, and Water. correct me if im wrong.",2022年7
6837,What does that mean? Is it a cleaner hit?,2022年7
6838,It’s made without using solvents. Normally concentrate is made with some type of solvent like butane for example to extract the concentrate from the plant. Solventless uses no solvent and is basically just putting weed into a heat press and squeezing out the concentrate which makes it taste better/more natural and cleaner,2022年8
6839,"real. for future reference, if you’re the first to verify it on verify.stiiizy (not the fake 1:1 site verify-stiiizy) it’s always real. counterfeits cannot verify for the first time on the actual site.  

as for the packaging, stiiizy like most brands, switches up packaging from time to time. this is the current packaging",2022年7
6840,That’s a legit cart,2022年7
6841,Real shit my boy,2022年7
6842,Can double confirm this - just got this exact G today.,2022年7
6843,how much do you guys pay for a pod?,2022年7
6844,Okay thank you yeah I haven’t gotten one in a while n it didn’t match up so I wasn’t sure looked through all these chats n was pretty sure it was real just needed extra reassurance lol thanks so much,2022年7
6845,What do you mean by 1:1 site? I’m fairly new to stiiizy compared to most here so just wondering.,2022年7
6846,Thank u,2022年7
6847,no problem. enjoy man 🤙🏼,2022年7
6848,Different doesn’t mean it’s fake some have different colors for like LR and what not,2022年7
6849,"there’s a fake verification website that looks exactly like the real one, except the url is different. real site is verify.stiiizy, fake one is verify-stiiizy",2022年7
6850,Oh ok never knew that. I just rescanned a couple of mine to make sure they are legit lol. I’m all good. Thanks for the info!,2022年7
6851,I tried it for him too 😂on the big battery it’s the same that shit killed me,2022年7
6852,For science…,2022年7
6853,Now how many hits(seconds ea) do you need to feel something off a Stiiizy?  For science of course.,2022年7
6854,Completely dependent on your tolerance level... for example my mom never smokes anything aside from bud will get high off of 4 (1-3 second) taps off my pod but it takes me a good 5-10 (5 second draw) hits to feel anything,2022年12
6855,Bruh your “friend” got in Mexico that shit ain’t real lol,2022年7
6856,Nope and even if it was the disposables suck. I had one one time and it died before I could finish it and they can’t be recharged.,2022年7
6857,"unfortunately no, batch id reads incorrectly and there’s no scratch off verification in the top right",2022年7
6858,they don’t have any verified stiiizy locations in mexico. that is a fake disposable. there should be a QR code on the right top corner to confirm if its authentic or not. sorry you got a fake disposable pen :(,2022年7
6859,I wonder what he was smoking cause that is fake af :(,2022年7
6860,Same thing happened to me,2022年7
6861,"My battery lasted longer than wax, u have to take longer hits for it not to die before wax finishes, like at least 4 second hits or longer",2022年7
6862,Yeah that’s why it’s stiiizy pods or no stiiizy. Hate the disposables.,2022年7
6863,"That ""PUSH HERE"" tab is a little intimidating huh..",2022年7
6864,There is tape at the top you need to cut first! Took me like a dozen to find that out haha,2022年7
6865,I hate these new boxes so much lmao,2022年7
6866,I do the same. Ain’t easy to open em 😂,2022年7
6867,Litterly cut too. I’ve tried with my finger nail a ball point pin and it just pushes it into the box. The tape is thick.,2022年7
6868,"All distillate is all the same, not specific to Stiiizy. It’s basically the alcohol equivalent of white claw flavors, distilled to the point where there is nothing but THC (or the flavorless malt liquor, in the white claw  example)",2022年7
6869,"Why do they even bother releasing different "" strains"" marked indica, sativa or indica if it's the the effect for all distillate?",2022年7
6870,^^ if you want strain specific effects you need live resin or rosin,2022年7
6871,I definitely think they hit different. Sativa ones don’t do much to me.,2022年7
6872,I definitely think they hit different. Sativa ones don’t do much to me.,2022年7
6873,"Flavor and variety, friend! Stiiizy is respectably honest about what they’re selling you. Distillate is exactly that - flavored thc, not “weed” - think white claw flavors, it’s all the same flavorless malt liquor at the base. They’re insane to offer live resin and solventless on a pod platform without variable voltage and lower voltage options, but that’s besides the point for now. The entry level Stiiizy pods use botanically derived terpenes, which is a fancy way of saying “not from weed” - these are mixes of popular terpenes that exist naturally in weed, but from other (often synthetic) sources. These have no psychoactive qualities. One level up is their CDT line, which means cannabis derived terpenes. These are distillate with actual cannabis terpenes, which may bring on some degree of an “entourage effect.” They generally taste more true to a real flower strain. The old top dog was live resin, which is made by a solvent extraction of uncured, fresh then frozen flower. This has closer to the “full” high that smoking flower provides and is true to strain. They’ve recently put our solventless, which I haven’t tried but is made with solventless, as the name implies, extracted hash rosin.",2022年7
6874,"They hit differently because of the THC percentage of the batch of distillate that particular mix is made from. The terps don’t add or remove any effect, they’re just basically flavor. They often use lower percentage batches with sativa to mimic the less drowsy stereotype of a light sativa",2022年7
6875,"That was brilliant. Thank you. I just picked up some live resin pods. If I take smaller tokes, do you think it will keep the oil ok?",2022年7
6876,"Yeah, you just want to let it cool down between hits or it’ll burn and avoid the big battery entirely. It’ll still get a little toasted by the end of the pod but such is life!",2022年7
6877,A favorite!,2022年7
6878,"i haven't tried the LR, as they don't have them in MI yet. however i've heard from lots that CDT is better",2022年7
6879,Nice toes,2022年7
6880,The cdt is not love resin tho NV saying the same thing it’s just distillate with terpenes added nothing compared to real live resin,2022年7
6881,heheh thanks bb 😘,2022年7
6882,CDT is super different than live resin … i wanted to try their cdt line that’s what this post is about,2022年7
6883,Yeah it’s just it says LR pod but the box is CDT,2022年7
6884,I’m saying it’s an improvement to the live resin pod. I bought a super glue lr pod and had to return it cuz that shit was nasty,2022年7
6885,Ohh I’m high lol 😝,2022年7
6886,Where tf did you get this,2022年7
6887,That's fire!🔥🔥🔥,2022年7

6938,You’ve just been hitting it nonstop. Set it down upright and all the little air bubbles will move to the top and you’ll see how much you’ve already smoked.,2022年7
6939,"Ive seen that kinda before i think its js a ton of tiny bubbles together that isnt filled w air yet like the bubbles at the top, looks good",2022年7
6940,Is the inside of your battery clean. Breath in it a bit and spin a q tip down against it it’ll clean the contact points. And breath a lil on the bottom of the stiiizy cart and wipe it well with a qtip. try it again and see if it has a better connection?,2022年7
6941,Those are the new tops for stizzy look like that but the oil looks fine to me. Could be the hot temperatures outside.,2022年7
6942,It’s just from hitting it a lot bro they all do that eventually if you’re ripping them,2022年7
6943,Was that bought at a legit dispo? Because it looks fake to me. In my state all the black stiiizy tops are smooth. Yours looks like it has texture to it. Did you scan the box? I’ve never seen that junk floating in any stiiizy pod ever.,2022年7
6944,damn we really need 8/8 photos to see this  common occurrence?,2022年7
6945,bubbles are normal … what am i missing here,2022年7
6946,Tiny bubbles are only dangerous when consuming your drugs through needle,2022年7
6947,I’m not familiar with the inside of a stiiizy pod but is it possible this is some of the wicking material that has come loose?,2022年7
6948,I thought of that but then I was like nah that can’t be it but bet bro I appreciate it I’ll check it out rn,2022年7
6949,I just bought this battery like a month ago it should be clean but I’ll clean my battery’s rn since you told me lmao appreciate it bro,2022年7
6950,I wouldn’t doubt it big battery + Vegas weather what can i say 😂,2022年7
6951,Vegas weather would definitely do that….try and keep it in AC or in the glove compartment of the car. Try and keep it face up or it’ll flow to the mouth piece.,2022年7
6952,Second this its happened to me dude to leaving the Pod in hot tempature.,2022年7
6953,I bought it off of someone cause I buy a few at a time for cheaper price but yea I scan most of them just to make sure they real and they always come out good,2022年7

6965,dude how many of y’all don’t get this no plug is gonna have real stiiizys fuck,2022年7
6966,Its fake the strain is never printed in the middle like that. Its always on a sticker on the corner,2022年7
6967,Fake there a new slimmer box now,2022年7
6968,just go to a dispensary.,2022年7
6969,"Fake, stizzy doesn’t put the strain name on the box, they have it on a sticker",2022年7
6970,pics are from 30 weeks ago tho,2022年7
6971,cuz i’m thinkin of buying from this plug but i wanna know if those stizzys are real yk what i mean?,2022年7
6972,"If ur down for it, buy a half gram to see if its real",2022年7
6973,"Sorry to ask a question under this but i have gotten no help, anybody ever had a pod not scan, but if you manually input the number, it verifies?",2022年7
6974,"These look a bit different from the packaging I be seeing at the dispos I hit, located in cali.",2022年7
6975,you too young to be smoking lol you’re literally 13,2022年7
6976,I even tried it again to see if it wud say i already verified it or if they did some crazy hack to make it say it was the first time being verified every time,2022年7
6977,When you first did it it said first time? Also what’d it say when you checked again? My iPhone 12 has a hard time picking up that little ass QR code. Could just be your phone. You can normally tell by the box if it’s real or fake though too if that’s what your worried about. Like this dudes here you can tell is fake by the box and by the strain name not being on a sticker in the bottom right corner.,2022年7
6978,These are so bad lmao,2022年7
6979,If they aren’t from the dispo they are fake! Don’t trust your stupid friend.,2022年7

6986,Looks fake,2022年7
6987,but is the box real for the time the pic was taken?,2022年7
6988,He’s 13 or 14 years old he can’t. OP I suggest you don’t buy shit from insta don’t use anything till you get older at least. Imma bet no good plug would sell to you because your age as they should,2022年7
6989,300 weeks,2022年7
6990,yea i might do that cuz i can’t go to a dispo and i’ve been tryna find a plug who sells real stizzys for a while so we’ll see,2022年7
6991,One that I scratched had a tiny spec of the scratch stuff left on it and it wouldn’t scan but I didn’t see it. So I tried to scratch it to make sure it’s all off then it worked. Try that.,2022年7
6992,No but is the QR code scratched or have something on it maybe it’s not reading,2022年7
6993,no sourcing,2022年7
6994,Probably not don’t see why anyone would still have them after months and months but buy 2 different pods if they taste the same you got fucked,2022年7

7012,I’ve had my pax longer than my stiiizy and I prefer the stiiizy.,2022年7
7013,I have both. Both stiiizy batteries small and big and also have the Pax era life and pro. Pax is cool cause the battery indicator and variable temps and if you have the pro it has the app and usb c charging . But I prefer stiiizy they hit better and I like that you can see how much you have left without pulling the pod out. They last longer. Pax is more available in my area then stiiizy though,2022年7
7014,plug play all day everyone knows pnp is the best out there its no secret 🤷🏻‍♂️,2022年7
7015,Stiiizy all day,2022年7
7016,Thanks for the feedback!,2022年7
7017,Thanks for sharing,2022年7
7018,"You could be right, but not a lot of dispensaries stock that brand. Every retailer sells Stiiizy; PAX could also be considered commonplace, but PnP? Never seen it on store shelves.",2022年7
7019,Gotcha,2022年7
7020,No problem. Anymore questions feel free to ask. I mean I personally do like both though. Best pod systems out way better then 510 carts.,2022年7
7021,u can go weedmaps if ur in washington or california they have em in more places than you might think.,2022年7
7022,all legal product from licensed dispensaries have full panel testing done,2022年7
7023,The Hardcore OG is great! What a vibe! Beautiful water show!,2022年7

7025,Helpppp meeeee,2022年7
7026,the back barcode is irrelevant. it’s the front scratch off verification that matters. you can post actual pics to help us help you,2022年7
7027,"Thanks and yea thats what i was trying to explain in my post, i originally was scanning the back, did some research realized im supposed to scan the front, when i tried, it wud not scan, but if i manually input the code, it verified so i was just wondering if it could be some kind of scam they running since it would not scan

Turns out i didnt completely clean off the barcode 😂😂😂 user error my bad",2022年7
7028,lol glad you figured it out. cheers and enjoy man,2022年7
7029,it looks like a broken liiil stiiizy,2022年7
7030,"that’s a liiil stiiizy never seen the inside of that and you prolly shouldn’t for the reason being they make em so you can only hit it whilst not having the inconvenience of getting a whole pod or cart or whatever mayb if you’re desperate to use sum crack wires but even then it seems useless mayb take the top off and heat the oil into another pod or cart to use that so that the wax won’t be wasted, safe travels.",2022年7
7031,"The contacts on disposable stizzys aren’t soldered in. They are wedged between the coil wire contacts and the battery output contacts in their rubber seal. There shouldn’t be an embedded diode inside the coil so it doesn’t matter which wire you pick to be + or -.

Gently slide the top cap off and use a sharp knife to Jimmy the rubber cap out with the metal contacts. Don’t jam your knife too deep since you may rip the PCB out of the battery  if you’re not careful.

Pass the coil contacts through the rubber seal and then jam in the battery PCB contacts inside the rubber holes. Also if there’s too much wax around the contacts use 90% alcohol to clean it with a Q-tip, your strongest vodka will not work. Give it a succ and if it doesn’t work make sure the contacts are properly cleaned and maybe switch the wire coils around. Make sure that the two cables are not able to touch and are semi-straight inside the rubber seal

Cheers :)",2022年9
7032,I started buying stiiiizy disposables in 2018 and they’ve been consistently absolute trash quality. I think it might just be their way of forcing people to buy their batteries lol,2022年7
7033,hm probably lol i like full stiizy pens theyre great its just that i like to try different brands a lot so i’d rather stick w the generic 510 thread batteries,2022年7
7034,"it’s bc they’re two different grow ops. you can’t transfer weed over state lines even in between legal states so every brand that operates in multiple states, has multiple different grows. often they outsource to other brands already established in that state which is why product varies from state to state, despite it being from the same brand",2022年7
7035,The more you know . Thank you,2022年7
7036,Yoo can somebody help me out,2022年7
7037,With my post,2022年7
7038,"its dead.

edit: there was a point when a certain pod bricked 3 of my batteries. stiiizy claimed that the batteries have a short shelf life, but i personally believe this particular pod bricked my batteries.",2022年7
7039,"I hate to ask the obvious, but you've charged it, right?",2022年7
7040,Wonder if that’s why they sell these: https://www.stiiizy.com/collections/smoking/products/stiiizy-replacement-power-case-adapter,2022年7
7041,"Yup, overnight actually. Was hoping I’d get a white light at some point but nothing",2022年7
7042,"How old are the batteries? 

Did you see the light change at all when you charged it? Perhaps the USB is done.",2022年7
7043,Probably burnt the battery charging it overnight you just need a quick 40 min charge,2022年7
7044,SMH that my all time favorite ahahaha,2022年7
7045,Blue burst taste like Smurf shit,2022年7
7046,Hot take: all the flavored pods I've tried are disgusting. The unflavored OGs and CDTs are the only ones worth it.,2022年7
7047,King Louie 🥭 or go home,2022年7
7048,The blue burst kinda tastes like a blue otter pop to me. I recommend Premium Jack and Pineapple Express pods as being the best flavors,2022年7
7049,Cap,2022年7
7050,Blue burst used to be my favorite but now its just tastes like blue fabric softener 🤢,2022年7
7051,"Blue Burst, Strawberry Cough & Pink Lemonade are the goat",2022年7
7052,Blue burst taste like leftovers,2022年7
7053,It taste like a Monster energy drink I don’t like it either,2022年7
7054,"i honestly think the og, cdt and live resin pods are not that great anymore ever since the solventless pods came out.",2022年7
7055,Blue Burst is like Blue Raspberry a shitty as flavor that’s just so artificial that it’s a fruit flavor that’s not actually a fruit,2022年7
7056,pod? or bud? i tried the bud and it was the best one i ever had,2022年7
7057,Lmfao. I like it. Taste like a slurpee. And the high hits. My gf said it taste like aluminum tho. Guess it’s just not for everyone. 🤣,2022年7
7058,Just bought a blue burst and strawberry cough and let me tell you when I cracked open that blue burst I just knew that shit was gonna slap and it did.,2022年7
7059,So many people thinks it’s gross but it’s literally my favorite. I love the berry flavors,2022年7
7060, Bugging the fuck out blue burst is fire,2022年8
7061,agreed smoking on one rn,2022年12
7062,"Dude I fully agree. OP, if you smoke flower though, the blue burst is one of my favorites!",2022年7
7063,CDTs wayyyy better than the live resin in my opinion,2022年7
7064,"Whats CDTs? Also, had a pod, wont scan, but manually inputting number verified product, does this ever happen where barcode wont scan but manually inputting works? Trying to figure out if im getting scammed",2022年7
7065,Nah I have a friend that put me on but it’s not that crazy. Watermelon z is my go to for indica,2022年7
7066,Ong,2022年7
7067,Tried Premium Jack and didn’t notice a discernible flavor. Tastes like weed and nothing else. To each their own I guess…,2022年7
7068,I fuck with pineapple homie.,2022年7
7069,"Solventless is a gimmick.

All oils including bho go through rigorous purification before being sold so technically they are all ""Solventless"".

On top of that, the battery burns the oil even if use it the way stiiizy instructs you too. 

Lastly you are paying $41 bucks for a "" half gram"" which is .38 grams.


CDT is best bang for your buck. 

Distillate which means is strong af and has cannabis terpines which provides cannabis effect.",2022年7
7070,You have my vote for Strawberry Cough. Excellent flavor but I wish it was stronger.,2022年7
7071,"Cannabis Derived Terpenes. The boxes with the silver leaves. 

I never had to scan, so idk.",2022年7
7072,My bad. I should have said that premium jack doesn’t have a flavor.,2022年7
7073,"Never had to scan ya stiizy cuz you got it from the website or something?  

And ok thanks for that info , dont know much about these",2022年7
7074,Got them from a verified partnered dispensary or Stiiizy stores.,2022年7
7075,"Got you, wish fkn somebody knew the answer lol",2022年7
7076,Dosi do for the better high and Pineapple Express for the high,2022年7
7077,"Both are good, both taste pretty good too. I would get Pineapple Express if it was me",2022年7
7078,I love the Pineapple Express,2022年7
7079,That’s the same thing,2022年7
7080,Whoops I was high when I typed that 😂,2022年7
7081,Would last longer if you use the regular battery instead of the biiig stiiizy too.,2022年7
7082,47,2022年7
7083,Bout 10 to 20 more. I’ve developed a trick to get the last drop out of these damn pods. Maybe I’ll post tutorial later,2022年7
7084,"that's a decent amount, you also have to consider the oil in the wick. if you stand it straight up, it will probably fill back up to a little less than half.",2022年7
7085,15-20,2022年7
7086,how often do u smoke a day tho,2022年7
7087,"Like 10, I always get half’s but I feel like once they are like halfway done, it’s clogs a little so then one hit uses so much it sucks",2022年7
7088,"Fr, I can't be the only one that thinks the biig is overkill. It fries pods to quickly.",2022年7
7089,Yesss! Do share! :),2022年7
7090,Please!  That end taste is the worst.,2022年7
7091,Whhaaaaat fr ?,2022年7
7092,Definitely does. Everytime I use the biiig one my shits gone in like 2 days. Lasts like 6 with the regular stiiizy,2022年7
7093,"Lol that means it’s already burnt, try not to hit it till that point. Anyways tutorial posted",2022年7
7094,"The OG pods have no legit strain, the distillate is bare bones with no real entourage effect. They’re all the same.",2022年7
7095,"I love sfv, its like a relaxing focused feeling in my expierience",2022年7
7096,Nah bro I feel like sfv og fs feel like a indica,2022年7
7097,U tried disilate or live resin,2022年7
7098,"Yep that’s what happens with distillate. You’re buying the strains flavors not affects. Distillate high will always be distillate high, this is why I prefer live resin so much more",2022年7
7099,Shit no way bro fckkkk no wonder just like the rhythm carts and select same old oil different tag ahahaha that’s why I moved to Cali fck the bullshit,2022年7
7100,Same for the cdt?,2022年7
7101,Distillate,2022年7
7102,"Stiiizys LR is nothing to be impressed about, it’s barebones and a horror show when it comes to their batch info.",2022年7
7103,"If you moved to Cali for weed, that sucks lmao. I even worked for a dispensary in CA and wouldn’t even recommend anyone move there for weed.",2022年7
7104,Same for the CDT. All just bare bone distillate.,2022年7
7105,You do realize that ‘indica’ and ‘sativa’ doesn’t matter when it comes to distillate? The strain you buy has everything to do with flavor not affects. If you want true strain affects try live resin.,2022年7
7106,I don’t fuck with stiiizy at all. I’m saying I prefer live resin in general over distillate,2022年7
7107,Nahh not for weed but for better prices and variety when it comes to real good shit not just the same tag different name,2022年7
7108,But I feel different effects on the cdt,2022年7
7109,"Do you have any documents to prove this? Not that I doubt it, would just love to dig into it.",2022年7
7110,"Only thing I actually have enjoyed from Stiiizy is their actual flower. It’s pretty good, but I’d only get it on sale TBH.",2022年7
7111,"Placebo, CDT pods use the same distillate as the OG Pods",2022年7
7112,It’s very common knowledge,2022年7
7113,I agree with you 100%.,2022年7
7114,"Yea but they introduce the original terpines back into the distillate.

A lot of the entourage effect comes from the terpines.

Matter of fact, it's the only pod that I feel offers any entourage effect.

Og pods - distillate 

LR - burns easy and makes me tired. 

Solvnetless - makes me tired.",2022年7
7115,"Ok, common knowledge = fact",2022年7
7116,Possibly fakes going around? Jars cannabis has boof carts. Their stiiizy carts were scanned 2-3 times each already after scratching it for the first time. Terp tanks off aswell.,2022年7
7117,Perhaps a touch of the Vid?,2022年7
7118,This just happened to me. The vapor was acrid and it burned like nothing I've had before...very upsetting,2022年7
7119,Yeah same here just picked up pineapple express 1 gram cart and it smells like the cotton inside has burnt really nasty taste,2022年7
7120,Could be but doubtful,2022年7
7121,Was going to get some BOGO Stiiiizy from jars metro center,2022年7
7122,?,2022年7
7123,Yep that's it. been happening to all too often,2022年7
7124,Covid,2022年7
7125,nah this has been going on for some time now,2022年7
7126,it took maybe a week to get here and the only problem i had with shipping was not being able to track the package,2022年7
7127,Bruh I ordered a big battery and small battery a few months ago and I accident didn’t put my apartment number and they never answered me so I didn’t get my money or the battery’s lmao,2022年7
7128,Same,2022年7
7129,Same.,2022年7
7130,Same. I ordered two regular ones and took about a week to ship out and then couldn’t track it. I ordered 2 big batteries like a month later and they came in like 2 days. I hear they’re swamped lately and having a hard time keeping up with shipping demands. But idk how true that is.,2022年7
7131,It honestly just looks old as shit. The pods start turning that color after a long time.,2022年7
7132,Maybe cause it’s empty,2022年7
7133,Dude they’re empty,2022年7
7134,"Typically when this happens, I’ll take a tweezer and very gentle tug the little metal connectors in the pod outward. Occasionally they’re a little further in rather than being flush and don’t make a great connection. Don’t pull them out too much though or you could potentially remove and lose the connecting piece.",2022年7
7135,oohh okay yeah i just found it so idk how long it’s been there haha do you think that’s why it’s not working?,2022年7
7136,The pod that is full is the one that isn’t working,2022年7
7137,"it could be idk i just found it, how could you tell the right one is empty?",2022年7
7138,honestly idk maybe try pressing it down on the battery to get it in there right if not u can still rip it the old charger wires way i think 🤣,2022年7
7139,Look at the oil around the coil and the side of the pod see how there’s a little around them. They were full at one point. Once you smoke enough of them it’s really easy to spot,2022年7
7140,thanks! lmao it’s worth a shot,2022年7
7141,"ohh thanks, yeahh i rarely get stiiizys haha So since the pod is still yellow is that oil? lmao It looks as if there’s oil on the perimeter",2022年7
7142,Yea and no there’s still oil in there but it looks old that’s why your pod stained like that. But it’s no good I mean unless you like smoking metal,2022年7
7143,thanks for all the info! and yikeees yeah guess it’s time to throw it away lmao,2022年7
7144,"I mostly only smoke live resin carts now, and i know Stiiizy hasn’t brought out the live resin pods to MI yet so i guess im trying the distillate🤷🏻‍♂️ CDT next",2022年7
7145,"stiiiz LR is a 6/10 compared to other options available.

Their CDT line is is best.",2022年7
7146,ugh i hate the disposables,2022年7
7147,cdts better,2022年7
7148,Really? I’m happy to hear this. Not big on distillate but the effects of this are really nice and i like the hardware. Ordering a biiig batt rn and i’ll pick up some CDT pods from the dispo later this week,2022年7
7149,"I hate disposables in general but it was the cheapest way to try stiiizy without having to drop $20 on a battery, it smacked, battery didn’t die on me before the oil ran out which was my only concern. I got my battery now though and I’m looking for deals on pods near me",2022年7
7150,Any specific strains you prefer?,2022年7
7151,yayyyy good,2022年7
7152,"Bisctotti Gelato, or OG KUSH",2022年7
7153,fridge,2022年7
7154,Fridge generally,2022年7
7155,"I used to be like this, but i figured out its all a mental thing, i overcame it and still smoke daily. Also some people just generally need thc to have a appetite or fight insomnia",2022年7
7156,Yes but I’m literally dying so I need it,2022年7
7157,"You mean do you rely on THC to do either….?

Stiiizy isn’t unique to this 😂😂",2022年7
7158,"I mean i use it for medical reasons, ive lost 10 pounds in a week cause i couldnt eat, stiiizy makes it so im not nauseous. also insomnia runs in the fam 🥵",2022年7
7159,"I had this problem, I stopped smoking stiizys for a while and smoke other cart and it made me wonder why stiizy made me feel that way",2022年7
7160,It isn’t mental at all. Daily use will clog your cannabinoid receptors causing your body to forget how to function when your not high. Eating and sleeping are the most effected areas of the body. If you don’t clear those receptors and or try to clear them it can result in Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome or just a really broken state of health,2022年7
7161,Technically you are correct but stiiizy/dab pens are much much more concentrated and potent than a blunt or a joint or even a bong rip,2022年7
7162,"I have lost 15 pounds and counting because I force myself to wait to smoke at night before bed, that’s the only time I’m hungry and I don’t even eat after smoking because I need to sleep and don’t want to train my body further to rely on it for appetite stimulation.",2022年7
7163,"I said mental cuz thats how i overcame it, but yes u are speaking facts",2022年7
7164,How do u clear them ?,2022年7
7165,How did u overcome it,2022年7
7166,3 month T break,2022年7
7167,I like it! Not my favorite flavor but a relaxing social high,2022年7
7168,How’s it taste,2022年7
7169,Whats FTP,2022年7
7170,Lmao bro sell me this battery rn 😂 don’t let me find out where you live lmaooo,2022年7
7171,"It’s a great green sour apple taste very similar to the plug n play flavor, I think it’s high enough to function still and not worry if you’re too high just with two hits lmao. But this pod is pretty good id consider buying it again Forsure",2022年7
7172,Fuck the population. $uicideboys,2022年7
7173,Fuck the police homie,2022年7
7174,Make an offer it’s in excellent condition,2022年7
7175,Not $b,2022年7
7176,Idk how much you looking for 😂,2022年7
7177,Swear? Are they just friends or some shit? Always thought it was their brand,2022年7

considered ive used mine but its in really good condition i'd do $85 w/ box but willing to negotiate with it lmk if serious",2022年7
7179,No they are cool but ftp is it’s own thing they rep it and all and have even had a collab with their record label g59 but nope it’s zacftps thing,2022年7
7180,Bet I’m about to text you,2022年7
7181,I was told stiiizy pulled out of Washington sadly,2022年8
7182,"Hate the live resin line from them..no matter what flavor it is it’s always burnt..next time stick with CDT, I highly recommend pink açaí",2022年7
7183,the dark color is normal for stiiizy live resin. could be an older pod that’s why it tastes off or bc the stiiizy battery runs too hot for live resin,2022年7
7184,"that BIIIG battery will burn your live resin pods, if you have the slim try that next time",2022年7
7185,Not the biggest fan of their live resin either,2022年7
7186,Super glue doesn’t sound like a real strain from them either bruh,2022年7
7187,Honestly I don’t trust any pod or vape brand to push out a fire live resin product my go to  are live resin diamonds. Way easier on the pockets and they deliver 👌🏾,2022年7
7188,"That's way old no wonder, since they don't even use that warning label on the new batches.",2022年7
7189,All stiiizy live resin pods look like that. Does it taste like shitty beer? That’s what I compare it too. There’s no getting around this. Stick to the OG line,2022年7
7190,Yes same thing happened to me. All of those carts are super dark for some reason,2022年7
7191,I’ll try it with the smaller battery maybe it will taste better… it’s pretty terrible,2022年7
7192,Was going to say the same. My big battery always seems to give burnt taste.,2022年7

It’s not a legit check buddy",2022年7

7195,"There may be a few who have sum decent that’ll get u smacked, but I feel like live resin shouldn’t be crammed into a vape. It’s a lot of compounds that go into it",2022年7

7197,"Yeah use the smaller battery and try to drag it fornonly 7 seconds and for it too coold down vefore ripping again.

Usually thr live resins and rosin pods heat up way faster and if it gets too hot it gives a burnt taste.

7201,clearly I’m not enjoying it if I’m posting complaining about it,2022年7
7202,I feel u but think about how much a live resin vape product goes for price wise ESPECIALLY THIS STIIIZY POD I grabbed a live resin birthday cake pod and was not satisfied mainly because it was so damn expensive Could have bought a 8th of some fire diamonds,2022年7

Edit: fell down a dab rabbit hole and ended up buying a PuffCo Peak Pro so I probably won’t use this stuff that much. The Q-tips and terp pearls will probably be it. The torch I ordered to use with the banger came today. If the butane for the torch comes before the Puffco I’ll probably use it once or twice and then put it away.",2022年7

I was getting some sent to me in the past and paying 40 but if I bought more then 5 at once was paying 30 and would usually get at least 10 at a time but can’t get those ones anymore.

Have you tried one yet?

Edit: Nvm. I see that those flavors are Stizzy blunts as well. 

I’ve only tried the blue burst and strawanna out of the Studenglass. Pineapple Express was pretty dope. The blunts were really harsh on my wife so we that’s why we experimented with the Studenglass and holy fuck that was amazing with the blue burst. 

I think Stizzy has like 12 flavors tho. Pretty wild.",2022年7

Only problem is that the blunt will leave a residual taste in the Studenglass that will need to be cleaned. I personally loved the residual taste from the blunt on my future bowls but I was able to get the residual taste out with cleaning with alcohol.

Edit: just make sure you get a good even light on your blunt with a cigar lighter or something of that nature and then put that Stizzy blunt in the Studenglass.",2022年7

the three III’s on the pod have not been used since late 2019/early 2020 at the latest, this claims to be made this year. since then they’ve been using the word “stiiizy” where they were. if you don’t know this it’s bc you haven’t bought a legit stiiizy pod from a licensed dispo in years or at all which is pretty clear at this point. 

and again you’re wrong on your last point. California didn’t start requiring CA! warnings on the carts and pods till late 2019/start of 2020, look this up before you respond. i’ve been buying stiiizys since the company started dude, this is 100% fake. if you keep pushing this you will be temp banned for pushing/encouraging use of fakes as legit product",2022年7

7411,Cookies indeed makes full grams😂do your little research then come talk😂🤙,2022年7
7412,"Og Kush, Strawnana, watermelon Z, their CDT pods are where it’s at..I know at this point everyone always says the same thing but the distillate is way too sweet and the live resin always seems to burn",2022年7
7413,Birthday cake,2022年7
7414,Hardcore OG made me sleep too much I know thats probably what its used for but I would wake up feeling groggy asf,2022年7
7415,I hated blue burst !!! Tastes and smells terrible,2022年7
7416,"Blue dream — felt like I was going to pass out. I also NEVER hit sativas so that might’ve been why 
Og kush — tasted bad and way too sweet. The high made me feel weird and anxious which I rarely experience smoking indicas. This one tested at like ~94 % 

Watermelon Z  — same thing ^",2022年7
7417,"Strawnana, made me feel WEIRD and tasted too sweet for my liking",2022年7
7418,I bought White Durban and hit that for a good day and didn't feel much of a difference,2022年7
7419,Blue Burst tastes like cheap Kool-Aid to me.,2022年7
7420,king louis,2022年7
7421,"Anything without a flavor. I know thats not what most people like but, it’s mostly just OGK tbh. White Raspberry or some like Gelato pass",2022年7
7422,Strawanan gave me such a weird high but that’s just me I’m not a Sativa person,2022年7
7423,In my opinion Wedding cake is pretty awful,2022年7
7424,"gelato get me a weird high, so sleepy but not really high",2022年7
7425,I’ve purchased three of the solventless pods and all tasted terrible.,2022年7
7426,"Straw nana is straight but the flavor is strooong as hell, lol. I just got a blue burst one and that is the same way but fire.",2022年7
7427,What is the main difference between a CDT a and OG pod,2022年7
7428,Strawnana isn’t a sativa,2022年7
7429,That’s sad i really was looking forward to trying those,2022年7
7430,I just despise that really sweet flavor..I can’t lie blue burst is fire 🔥🔥,2022年7
7431,"Og pods use botanical terpenes found in all plants, while CDT pods use cannabis derived terpenes giving each strain the flavor that comes from that particular strain of weed. Kind of like artificial sweetener vs sugar",2022年7
7432,It hit me like a Sativa sorry I forgot it’s a hybrid,2022年7
7433,Hahahahahah so funny. The one on the floor reminds me of my first time trying stizzy,2022年7
7434,Mad props gundam wing ftw,2022年7
7435,TIL that smoking weed is a hobby,2022年7
7436,Bro I paid a hundred bucks apart in New York every time I go I get KY ready,2022年7
7437,AHAHAHA lol,2022年7
7438,"my first time trying stiizy it was 2 years ago and i didn’t have a battery so i wired it, and my “buddy” at the time taxed the fuck out of me but i was desperate. pretty sure i ended up paying 90 bucks for a pod that i only really hit 3 times and god knows what happened to it, pretty sure my car ate it just like the rest of my shit",2022年7
7439,What’s TIL stand for?,2022年7
7440,Did you find out? I’m curious LOL,2022年7
7441,Strawberry cough is a great OG pod. As far as cdt line I personally like GMO and super green crack,2022年7
7442,Get their new solvent less line or CDT if that’s all there is and no live resin,2022年7
7443,White Durban is one of my personal favorites! I personally don’t like their solventless and live resin pods but they do their job alright. My personal go to is strawberry cough though if you want to try an og pod.,2022年7
7444,"If you can get any other than these, I prefer OG Kush or White Raspberry",2022年7
7445,I wouldn’t get a strong indica first they’ll make you like really feel ughh afterwards. Maybe for for a sativa or hybrid,2022年7
7446,stick to normal 510 carts lol the battery sucks,2022年7
7447,I like that flavor but it isn’t a good first one as far as taste. Very light backend Apple. It’s not an “oh wow!” flavor if that makes sense.,2022年7
7448,did u get it yet and u fw it?,2022年7
7449,CDT is actually distillate by the way!,2022年7
7450,Cdt 🥇🥇🥇⛽️,2022年7
7451,Try premium jack.  It's such a good pod.,2022年7

7453,I get my full gs for 28 ea,2022年7
7454,"R.I.P to the stiiizy super green crack, grape ape & super lemon haze CDT pods. No idea why they stopped making them, they were all such bangers.",2022年7
7455,"Solventless is really good but towards the end the pod does change flavor, the CDT lineup is outstanding but first try a normal stiizy consisting of either hybrid or indica you won’t be disappointed",2022年7
7456,second this 👍,2022年7
7457,"The CDT lines are all made in seasonal batches hence why they disappear, but they do come back from time to time.",2022年7
7458,i just hate how fucking fast they burn🥲,2022年7

7474,"Oh got you, nice",2022年7
7475,yeah sb the shit for real they make that dabbead music fr ive taken so many dabs and smoked so much dope to their music lol,2022年7
7476,[removed],2022年7
7477,Only found the batt. Bought the pods later. after I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol.,2022年7
7478,Its hard for me to remember a time when i didnt smoke with $b in the background lol,2022年7

7495,First pod I cracked opened on my first trip to Cali 🔥🔥,2022年7
7496,First pod I’m cracking open right now!! Soooo tasty.,2022年7
7497,The best Stiiizy Distillate pod IMO,2022年7
7498,That's my favorite combo. I have a battery like that too.,2022年11
7499,Tbh I liked it a lot better yea,2022年7
7500,I heard it burns the pods MUCH easier,2022年7
7501,Bro ion know if I need that my Regular Stiiizy batts burn through oil like crazy. Or I just smoke a lot 🤷‍♂️,2022年7
7502,The big battery is just a waste imo. Just stick with the small battery and don’t take back to back hits. It takes a bit for the coils to cool down. So if you do back to back hits it will burn the oil and fuck up the cotton,2022年7
7503,I have asthma so I’m little hits only.,2022年7
7504,"That’s good then, just don’t take hits back to back",2022年7
7505,If the pod was authentic and u scanned it then it shouldn’t be blinking that’s the sign of a broken/faulty/ black market pod. I had a few that were black market that did exactly what ur describing,2022年7
7506,Go get a qtip n clean in there. It might help. Or rub the bottom of the pod with your finger. It helps me if theres any connection issues. If that aint help. Its prolly fake homie,2022年7
7507,Push the 2 gold circles in a little under the cart with a toothpick or needle after you clean it and it should work after you put it back into the battery,2022年7
7508,I agree with you Some stiiizy pods taste like black pepper,2022年7
7509,We should make a list of the blacklisted flavors,2022年7
7510,"GDP is one of my favorites...sweet grapes.
   If it doesn't taste like grape, it's probably either burnt, or faulty.",2022年7
7511,You prob just got a burnt pod my dude,2022年7
7512,Yeah it's peppery like the description white raspberry is also peppery,2022年7
7513,From what ive seen with gdp is either you get a really earthy flavor or you get a strong grape flavor and that is depending on the person. Everytime ive had gdp its grape to me but to my coworker its like dirt,2022年7
7514,facts bruh shits ass,2022年7
7515,I think its fake ive had one like that before and it was fake,2022年7

7522,It seems either people love or hate GDP strains. I don’t mind it. The names of the strains make me chuckle. 🤣,2022年7

7524,Mine taste fine,2022年7
7525,White raspberry,2022年7
7526,Blue Burst,2022年7
7527,"Idk maybe it’s just me, I’ll let a friend try and see what they think.",2022年7
7528,I mean it doesn’t taste burnt but more kind of earthy. It’s hard to explain,2022年7
7529,I already verified it,2022年7
7530,I wish I did. I got mine from a local plug. I wanna find a neon orange or neon blue one next,2022年7

7562,Two days ago I believe,2022年7
7563,I just plugged it in and the light was red for about a minute then it changed to white,2022年7
7564,"Bite the plastic top off lol. Leave it in a hot car before doing so so the oil inside is nice & viscous, then carefully pour it into the donor pod, when replacing the top of the refill pod be sure to line up the air holes how they where, or it’ll be a very airy hit. Source: the struggle",2022年7
7565,try to wire hit it basically when u cut up an android wire so the bare copper wire that’s inside is showing and u put it to the 2 little round metal pieces directly under the pod,2022年7
7566,Get a fork put 1 or the 4 sticks in the mouth piece hole and take it out now get a lighter and carefully heat it up not too hot and pour the wax into another pod or cart,2022年7
7567,Can u just dab it on a rig or pen? I don’t have an empty stiiizy pod,2022年7
7568,"ok if u leave it in the car, just make sure to not leave it in there too long cuz it can leak due to the heat",2022年7
7569,That’ll work just try to cold start that dab so you don’t burn it,2022年7
7570,Good note. I’d check on it after 20,2022年7
7571,20 might be a little too long m8 if it’s more than 90 out,2022年7

7662,That's my all time favorite,2022年6
7663,What’s the taste man?,2022年7
7664,I get it :),2022年6

7666,"I did this 2 weeks ago with 2 pods, a disposable and gummies. You’re mos def good just put them with your toiletries",2022年6
7667,You can fly flower too,2022年6
7668,Yeah these pods don’t seem ready. I was unimpressed with these and their version of Jeeters.,2022年6
7669,"I agree CDT is the best bang for your buck with Stiiizy. However, if anyone is still interested in the solventless pods FlowerCo has them for only $27 per half gram pod.",2022年6
7670,/r/boneappletea 😂,2022年6
7671,I can agree with absolutely everything here but I really did feel a better high with these pods,2022年6
7672,"The high is very nice. My issue is that it's not much better than CDT for the price. Also, the argument of solventless being healthier is bunk.  Both products go through purification.

Having said that, I believe stiiizy is on to something. If they can release a variable battery, solvenless will easily be my favorite line.",2022年6
7673,"I have to diss agree again, CDT does not hit like these so, either you’re hitting it wrong or you’re just very sensitive to that scale of product bc they don’t affect me like that.",2022年6
7674,"No no. You are correct. Cdt is basically a whiskey where solventless is bourbon. Both are great. Once stock is increased and they work out the bugs, I have no doubt that solvenless will be my favorite.

As of now, I just don't noticed a huge difference. I don't take blinders or anything.",2022年6
7675,"Stiiizy is my preferred choice as well. I’ve tried many many 510 cartridges and there’s just something about the Stiiizy oil that doesn’t mess with my lungs or throat. Plus the price point is great in California and you can’t beat the ease of portability, lack of smell, and awesome flavors. I can literally hit this thing anywhere I want and no one will ever know.",2022年6
7676,"I know this doesn't answer your question but I started out using 510's. Always gave me chest pain and would mess up my throat bad.
Stiiizy popped up on Eaze one day, I was curious and yeah I will never trade my Stiiizy.
So smooth, convient, affordable...I could go on. I haven't tried the CDT pods yet so just waiting for my next re up.",2022年6
7677,I fw stiiizys heavy but alot of ppl I know who smokin stiiizy starting to slowly faze out and switch to plugnplays. I personally fuck with both though,2022年6
7678,I don't totally understand your question. But I do love stiiizy. It is the cartridge brand that I will use.,2022年6
7679,"stiiizy are good. I would say the only comparable pods that may be better are Pax. for instance, Jetty makes good resin for pax pods",2022年6
7680,"So I’ve been using the stizzy for almost a year now and well I’m gonna be honest it’s the best fit for me, smooth yet relaxed high, some hit heavy and once the moment of high hits it’s so nice, I’ve had some other brand carts that just don’t hit the same and always give me throat burns and they all either taste like oil or something bad, and the flavored ones ain’t the same like stizzy pods,
And it’s so great that I can take it to places that have metal detectors and still be able to get high, and not only that but they don’t break easily like puffin carts/disposable and the look of it just looks slick, and clean",2022年6
7681,"i have also tried many brands, from various 510 to stiiizy to plugnplay, honestly stiiizy is perfect for frequent users.. as long as you are being mindful of how much you are consuming daily and not letting your tolerance build too much, you can get consistent highs from the distillate line. Stiiizy is also waaay easier on my lungs and throat than plugnplay... i buy both frequently and i ALWAYS find myself coughing for at least a few seconds when i take any big hits, and it just feels less discreet, from the size of the pen to the smell, to the cough attacks. Don't get me wrong though; I haven't found another distillate brand that truly hits like real deal PnPs, so i value that every now and then. I hear other criticisms saying Stiiizy doesn't hit like a dab or a plugplay, but i really value stiiizy for the discreetness, variety, and overall clean high.",2022年6
7682,"I worked for stiiizy and saw the harvest info for pods and shit. Honestly, any other brand is superior. Stiiizy uses bottom of the barrel trim and shake to make distillate. Their prerolls are a mix of flower. The 40s Aren’t live resin, they’re clearly distillate. Trash ass overhyped company if you do your research.",2022年6
7683,I know exactly what ur saying dude. Yes. 💯 percent Dude. These feel different and better then 510 threads or anything I’ve tried,2022年6
7684,"i think it has a lot to do with the way stiiizy markets their stuff, it’s all unique in it’s own way, consistent, and reliable, which makes for a good product 👍🏽",2022年6
7685,"I don’t know honestly. I didn’t smoke a lot during pandemic since wasn’t at college, but could’ve SWORE it used to be better back in the day. Nowadays I couldn’t even last like 3 days a cart",2022年6

7690,ive been with stiiizy for years now ! my favorite fr sure !!,2023年6
7691,This is the gas I need! I thought it was in my head but hearing stories like these is validating haha.,2022年6
7692,THIS. Okay I thought I was crazy for having chest pain after using this different pen this weekend. It just didn't seem right and I wasn't sure if it was the pen - has to be. That's the only thing that's changed,2022年6
7693,"i started with plug play, I'd stay with them if they weren't so hard to get compared to stiiizy. i still fw stiiizy tho.",2022年6
7694,"I haven’t heard of plug play before, sounds like a good alternative if I don’t have access to my stiiizy. I just checked em out, seem very similar",2022年6
7695,PlugPlay re adds cannabinoids to their distillate which makes them a far superior product and brand. Stiiizys distillate is bare bones and offers no real entourage effect besides a botanical flavor.,2022年6

7703,"Anytime I look this up on the internet, 510 threads dominate. They also shit on stiiizy!!",2022年6
7704,Interesting. That’s how my body reacts to other pods that aren’t Stiiizy. I’ve heard two Raw Garden recs.,2022年6

7710,"i’d recommend raw garden over stiiizys normal line and their cdt line. they taste great, all the cannabinoids come straight from the plant and it’s a glass cart, no plastic. for distillate go for raw garden. for live resin go for buddies, cannabiotix or friendly farms (my favorite lol)",2022年6
7711,How much are the pax pods in los angeles??,2022年6

7748,The CDTS have more of a punch to them in my opinion I haven’t gone back to a normal stiiizy wax strain in a while but all their wax’s are fair to in quality taste n high in a fair perspective,2022年6

7761,"Youre thinking about actual flower or full spectrum extracts, distillate is distillate is distillate as long as its clean, its just thc. Doesnt matter what the flavor is its all the same thing

Edit: also yes it’s taken from the flower but i dont see how that has anything to do with anything. The extract has been distilled to isolate the thc specifically so im not sure what you meant by that part, my bad.",2022年6
