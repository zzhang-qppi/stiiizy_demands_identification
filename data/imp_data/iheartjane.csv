0,"March 13, 2023",It wasn‚Äôt like the one in the picture but I‚Äôm still satisfied tho
1,"October 21, 2022",This is fine it's their website that sucks.
2,"August 27, 2022",Very good battery but the product I used was trainwreak with that battery 10/10..
3,"May 30, 2022",Badass battery. Go Biiig or go home!
4,"November 29, 2021",Fix your website. It said to drop by between 9 and 10 and you were closed. Total BS.
5,"June 22, 2021",this battery hits hard if you are looking for a good dab pen
6,"March 13, 2021",Nice big clouds. Long lasting battery. Just what you need my high tolerance friends
7,"March 11, 2021",Easy use
8,"January 3, 2021",Love it
9,"December 16, 2020","Battery lasts about 3 days and so easy to take it on the go, also very small for pockets"
10,"November 25, 2020",Love the big stiiizy! It charges quickly and has a long battery life. The pods click in easily and fit very secure. My brother pulled one out to show someone and my 8 year old walked in and asked what it was. I was able to quickly convince her that it was like a Roku or Fire stick type thing with no questions lol so it works out great if you‚Äôre needing to be discreet.
11,"September 15, 2020",Works wonders! Gives me pretty good hits compared to a 510 or regular Stiiizy batteries. Would Highly recommend!
12,"June 7, 2020",good battery last long
13,"May 12, 2020",A+
14,"May 11, 2020",Battery size is very compact and discreet. Love the size and shape.
15,"March 28, 2020",It‚Äôs sleek and a little more discreet. Packs a good punch. I‚Äôve tried many 510 thread batteries but they would always break or voltage wasn‚Äôt strong enough. So I finally gave in to getting A pod type battery. Definitely happy with my purchase.
16,"September 3, 2023",First time buying the Stiiizy brand. Great experience!
17,"July 29, 2023","IMO..They Are Cheap And Taste Nasty I mean leave a bad taste in your throat., Also I Dinno About The Slick Ass Batteris I Cant Seem To Hold On To Them.PSssssT..Batttey does not stay Charged Very Long Either.."
18,"May 22, 2023",Would definitely buy again üëçüèº
19,"March 31, 2023",It is a very piney gassy pod! I like that even tho it‚Äôs a indica strain it doesn‚Äôt make you sleepy to the extent of being stuck. You can definitely shop and hit this pod
20,"November 22, 2022",I loved dosi. Best flavor.
21,"November 9, 2022","Do-si-dos has been my favorite stizzy carts for a long time. It's best after work before dinner - I relax, I get hungry, and I sleep well."
22,"October 31, 2022","I remember this feeling like a traditional hybrid and didn't notice the indica too much.

The experience will vary, person to person but for those that prefer indica... this may not be the best option. This is probably good for social stuff."
23,"May 14, 2022",Second time I‚Äôve bought the dosidos and does not work‚Ä¶
24,"April 5, 2022",I enjoy this strain very much
25,"April 2, 2022",Listed as Indica but package said hybrid. Assume it is an Indica dominant plant. Best for relaxing and sleeping.
26,"March 28, 2022","It made me feel energetic, hungry and hard to sit still at times. I don‚Äôt mind it when I‚Äôm having a productive day, but when you‚Äôre playing video games, this fades really quick."
27,"February 25, 2022",it‚Äôs one of my faves!
28,"February 24, 2022","This pod is a distillate oil, this is meant for road trips and getting out of your normal head space! The vanilla flavor along with some nutty notes too makes this a dope ass high experience! Rip it and head over to grab a coffee or take a scooter ride through the neighborhood, pick this pod up with that GIRL SCOUT GREEN battery and head out on adventure with this STIIZY! üç™"
29,"January 28, 2022","Read a good book after a few hits, would recommend"
30,"December 2, 2021",Sweet flavor
31,"August 24, 2021",Great
32,"August 15, 2021",Dosidos is the best :)
33,"March 18, 2021",Like 90% thc one of the highest
34,"September 9, 2020",Great service
35,"September 1, 2020",this is my favorite flavor and it keeps me going with both energy and relaxation during the day
36,"July 2, 2020",Checked the QR code and it said it was the second one with the same code and it‚Äôs not suppose to be like that each one has a unique code that‚Äôs y is 1:1
37,"June 18, 2020",Quality product for a fair price. You get what you need at a fraction of the price of their competition. Would def recommend.!
38,"May 11, 2020","Didnt  give a head change at all.
The flavor of it was terrible when I hit it taste like plastic"
39,"May 5, 2020",Faaaaaadedd
40,"April 13, 2020",Bonsai Has The Best Products
41,"September 6, 2023",No hard high but clears thoughts
42,"August 13, 2023",Nice mellow energetic.
43,"June 22, 2023",Very Nice
44,"February 10, 2023","Not only do I love Stiiizy products, Connected is the BOMB with customer service"
45,"December 3, 2022",Awesome product
46,"November 27, 2022",Stizzy pods are the best the 1gr carts seem to last longer than other 1gr carts
47,"March 29, 2022",Great for relaxing and getting pain relief
48,"March 16, 2022","i feel high 20 seconds after hitting this one. this is my favorite stiiizy pod. try not to over eat before or after or you might feel very nauseous. that happens every to me often, since i use my pen around dinner time often."
49,"January 16, 2022",Does the job
50,"September 15, 2021",Great all around!
51,"August 13, 2021",Good high
52,"April 10, 2021",I didn‚Äôt care for the taste too much and the high is okay.
53,"March 19, 2021",Good indica
54,"February 2, 2021","gets the job done, i feel like they burn out quicker for some reason?"
55,"October 11, 2020",Munchies Hardcore gives you that laid back high with an after effect of the total munchies!
56,"September 6, 2020",Loved it
57,"July 3, 2020",This cartridge is amazing i only need 1 hit to be good for the night and i have the best sleep of my life i wake up feeling relaxed and ready to start the day! The high isnt too intense just enough for you to enjoy yourself and as well as being so concealable its amazing for an on the go high.
58,"June 29, 2020",High was nice while it lasted I ended up burning through it in 2 days.
59,"May 11, 2020",Vaping calms me down from pain and I‚Äôve found this product to work real well.
60,"August 26, 2023",I love stiiizy they‚Äôre the best I love stiiizy‚Äôs blue dream cuz taste like berry! ‚ù§Ô∏è
61,"August 26, 2023",I'm not angry anymore.
62,"August 21, 2023",I like the way it was easy to smoke and taste was vey pleasant.
63,"August 10, 2023",One of my favorites!
64,"August 5, 2023",Tasted Fruity and Yummy
65,"July 1, 2023",I liked it wish it was stronger
66,"June 17, 2023",smooth cart not too harsh and good taste
67,"May 31, 2023",I didn't get much from this vape..
68,"May 27, 2023",Blueberry üî•ü´£
69,"May 24, 2023",Good sativa. Really wakes you up and gets you going. Smooth and easy. Didn‚Äôt really taste like anything but it wasn‚Äôt a bad taste either.
70,"April 15, 2023",Blue Dream is always a good time
71,"April 4, 2023","This blue dream is the best to relax and think! However, any full gram Stiizy is not worth it. So much of the solution comes out as tar and sticks to your teeth, making them look black. This also causes more than half the product to be wasted, so, again, not worth buying a full gram. Stick with the half grams if they have it."
72,"March 7, 2023",Feeling a little anxious? A puff or two during the day eased my mind and got it refocused on what was important. It did not make me feel sleepy or high.
73,"March 4, 2023",This product is great for an afternoon of video games!!
74,"February 20, 2023","The name speaks for itself. Taste like blueberry slightly, but the cerebral and physical effects are DREAMY.  One of the greatest strains known to mankind."
75,"February 4, 2023","All Stiiizy products are super tasty, high quality & very effective~!"
76,"February 2, 2023",T stars cause I really liked the flavor but I spent the whole time trying to suck the vape out. It got clogged after every hit. A bunch of it would go into my mouth when I tried to suck it clear. It was hot! Got on my teeth and everything was sticky.  Waste of money.  After sucking it clear I probably ended up with 1/3 of what was there. The rest leaked out.  I tried it a second time  thinking it was a fluke. Nope. Did the same thing. So im out a bunch of money‚Ä¶
77,"January 13, 2023","Definitely a solid choice, though I think there is some blueberry flavor added that could be toned down. I'd prefer Stiiizy rosin pods but Artist Tree Fresno doesn't carry even a single one. Weird. So this is the one of the next best choices."
78,"January 7, 2023",Love the taste
79,"January 7, 2023","It did meet my expectations, I do recommend this product!"
80,"December 31, 2022",Love this for relaxing or going to sleep.
81,"December 25, 2022","I sucked 90 percent of the wax through the mouth piece. I ate alot of wax and was hot. It was a good high but not worth hitting it and sucking out a good portion of wax every time,  and being clogged."
82,"December 10, 2022",Ok
83,"December 5, 2022",One of ym favorite
84,"November 30, 2022",Good but not worth the price for the small amount
85,"October 30, 2022",Very tasty reminds me the flower.
86,"October 10, 2022",It was awesome
87,"September 25, 2022","i love blue dream, tastes amazing!"
88,"August 6, 2022",5stars
89,"July 15, 2022","This is my favorite Stiiizy Pod flavor because the Blueberry flavor really goes well with the Blue Dream extract. I've only found a handful of other OG Pods that have good flavoring, but this is by far the most consistent every time. If you're a fan of flavored nic vapes but want to switch to thc, I highly recommend this as a flavored vaping alternative."
90,"June 17, 2022",Great for every day life üòäüòäüòä
91,"May 22, 2022",def my fav hits hard even if you got a tolerance
92,"May 22, 2022",Good stuff!
93,"May 20, 2022",Love all the Stiizy This was no disappointment either
94,"April 21, 2022",It was great
95,"April 17, 2022",It kind of gave me a headache and the high wasnt as good as the other sativas.
96,"April 15, 2022",My absolute favüòòüëåüèª
97,"April 7, 2022","Great tasting berry flavor. Awake, talkative relaxing buzz. Good one to take when you are out and about socializing or want to have a lazy afternoon/evening playing games or watching a movie. A toss up between Blue Dream or Do-si-dos during the day for me, either one will be a good choice!"
98,"April 1, 2022",Always love the blue dream. Very good for creativity!! :)
99,"March 25, 2022",I love stiizy their products never disappoint
100,"March 5, 2022",Using this for depression and anxiety during the day. Very smooth and love the battery pack .. just puff no pushing buttons easy breezy
101,"February 20, 2022",Kind of made me jittery
102,"February 13, 2022",Perfect!
103,"February 4, 2022","Blue Dream has definitely changed how I feel when being on it, from 10 years ago to now. Now as I‚Äôm older I feel more energetic, it keeps me on track with stuff I need to get done for the day. Overall it‚Äôs a good experience if you‚Äôre wanting to be alert. If you‚Äôre wanting to chill; best pick something else."
104,"January 29, 2022","Blue dream is a great strain...
But, STIIZY blue dream is amazing!!"
105,"December 17, 2021","Such a good strain. The immediate relief from anxiety and panic, nausea, insomnia and headaches is a god send! The flavor is fruity and great too! Overall fire!"
106,"December 11, 2021",Blue dream is one of my all time favorite strains
107,"December 3, 2021","Love this stuff. Spend 10 minutes on my porch with this and a mt dew and I'm feeling great for the rest of the night. 10/10 tastes good too, not too grassy."
108,"December 1, 2021",Blue dream is the go to whether I‚Äôm tryna get a skate sesh in or just chill and kick it at the pad
109,"November 28, 2021","Blue dream is my all time favorite. Only strain I  smoke. Very enjoyable, happy, energetic, outgoing. Brings you out of your shell. A lot more active also great for the late night activities. I highly recommend"
110,"November 13, 2021",Extreme experience. Great taste and easy to use. Worked 12 hours pain free around the house and yard! Felt good to get off the couch for a change! Looking forward to the next experience!!!!
111,"October 27, 2021","I like stizzy pods and this one is no exception to the many I have tried. The flavor is very minimal compared to the others, but overall high is good."
112,"October 24, 2021","Very clean taste, high was great."
113,"October 15, 2021",Best Stiiizy  sativa cart to be honest
114,"September 20, 2021","Really great flavor, and euphoric feeling"
115,"September 16, 2021",Easy go to. Not overwhelming &able to function through the day. Not overwhelming with hunger but eases nausea
116,"August 7, 2021",Gets you blasted
117,"July 28, 2021",Nice high that takes the edge off the pain from my recent hip surgery.
118,"July 22, 2021","I don't vape anymore, but the product was good."
119,"July 12, 2021",the flavor is pretty good
120,"July 3, 2021",Overall great product
121,"July 1, 2021","It's a classic strain and performs as advertised. However, I did not like the taste  or the after taste."
122,"June 27, 2021",Highly recommended sativa!  Super great flavor. Stiiizy is my favorite daily driver vape.
123,"June 22, 2021",A little to much Blueberry Flavor. Otherwise does the trick. Makes me cough!
124,"May 10, 2021",Was very happy with it. Very close to the actual flower
125,"April 29, 2021",Great flavor
126,"March 18, 2021","Not bad, and it does have a rather ‚Äúblue‚Äù flavor to it. Very clean high. I‚Äôd buy it again"
127,"February 6, 2021",The contacts to the battery on this podare bad so. The dosing is really inconsistent
128,"October 11, 2020","Great taste, smooth high, and overall good experience. Would buy again!"
129,"September 1, 2020",Tasty treat as always! Definitely felt the chill buzz while also feeling stimulated. I was able to still get things done without a grumpy attitude.
130,"August 25, 2020",This has a great sativa effect.   Solid boost but without the paranoia. Solid choice for socializing.
131,"August 4, 2020",.....excellent.
132,"July 21, 2020","Stiizy is probably the best of best of the disposable Vape Pens - Blue Dream, as a flower product, had always been one of my favorites:  zesty taste (esp. in vaporizing flower); immediate calming & produces energy (I usually walk 2-3 miles daily) - with the Stiizy it is even more enhanced; and a little goes a long ways!"
133,"July 12, 2020","Blue Dream is great but sadly, the driver was out and it was replaced with the as great strawberry cough."
134,"June 23, 2020",The best product I've purchased
135,"June 17, 2020",Blue Dream has long been a go-to strain for me; Stiiizy makes it so easy to enjoy!
136,"June 16, 2020","I've been using blue dream for years.  I would say it is my go to for sure.  Just watching TV is interesting for me but I LOVE the feeling when we are ""getting busy"" in the bedroom, back yard, etc."
137,"May 30, 2020",5th  one love the strain
138,"May 10, 2020",Good herb. Really enjoyed.
139,"May 8, 2020",Blue dream is the shit.
140,"April 27, 2020",Yes
141,"April 21, 2020",I love stiiizy products and trees by far has the best prices best quality and customer service best all-aroundüòä but as far as the Disney cartridge Blue Dream goes I'm very satisfied with this cartridge
142,"January 28, 2020","Works great, smooth pull and relaxing."
143,"January 4, 2020",Not bad!! But too weak!!
144,"July 10, 2023",Highly recommend great taste wonderful high!!!!
145,"July 1, 2023",Is aite
146,"June 25, 2023",Best stuff I've ever had! I'll be back again!
147,"June 21, 2023",This is one of my go to for r n r
148,"June 4, 2023",Yes it did meet my expectations very good product recommend it for relaxing
149,"May 31, 2023","The King Louis is my go-to for helping me fall asleep. I have a tendency to not stay asleep,  so this really helps me get more sleep."
150,"May 27, 2023",High asf üî•üëÄ
151,"May 20, 2023",It was good Holmes
152,"May 13, 2023","I enjoyed it , 2 hits get me ripped and it taste good 10/10"
153,"May 5, 2023","mellow, tastes like soap... Won't purchase again"
154,"March 17, 2023","Great for being distillate. Doesn't burn, great taste, I tried this and the Do Si Dos along with Platinum Jack and I believe this one has live resin terps in it as I don't get an irritation when exhaling. Lasts a lot longer than typical 510 carts as well and a better hit/air flow. The battery could be better, it dies pretty fast, but they were free, so what do you expect? lol. 9/10 stars, would buy again. Great for sleep as well."
155,"March 11, 2023",This is by far a GREAT product - both quality and taste were on point and will be buying again. Im thrilled to find a hard hitting indica that DOESNT give me the munchies =) I was enticed to try this out since I got the battery for free since you cant use the typical round one.
156,"March 8, 2023",I‚Äôm not sure why exactly but Stiiizy seems to give me anxiety instead of high and they don‚Äôt seem to last very long
157,"February 25, 2023",Indica dominant strain with heavy hitting effects similar to that of cookies or a good OG very nice tasting and food over all effects .
158,"February 4, 2023",Perfect!
159,"January 24, 2023",Super dank
160,"January 12, 2023","I only fw stiiizy, I never not get high when I smoke stiiizy lol"
161,"January 3, 2023",Great quality.
162,"November 22, 2022",great taste and stoney
163,"November 10, 2022","I use King Louie to relax and sleep at night. 
I recommend this if you have a hard time getting settled in the evening."
164,"October 9, 2022",Amazing flavor that will put you to bed
165,"September 18, 2022","All the above positive feelings. 
beyond my expectations! 
I‚Äôll be buying this again."
166,"July 25, 2022","Hey hey hey how are you all today, I hope all my cannabis connoisseur‚Äòs out there are having a great day and staying medicated!!! I just wanted to stop by today and share my experience with a king Louis xIII stizzy pods! And tbh they are my favorite pod yet!! It‚Äôs got a great taste super euphoric and most of all very very very relaxing!!  I definitely recommend this product for people who have suffering from high stress unmanageable anxiety and if you are having trouble sleeping"
167,"July 15, 2022",Best indica
168,"June 12, 2022",So happy I found a strain that doesn‚Äôt give me munchies!
169,"June 2, 2022","King Louis is a classic pod that will always hit! A solid body and head high that‚Äôs relaxing, it does make me pretty tired the next day but that‚Äôs to be expected"
170,"April 1, 2022",Favorite stiiizy strain most consistent high and flavor is not too strong
171,"March 25, 2022",Enriched my hiking experienceüíö
172,"February 12, 2022",Very flavorful and body relaxing for muscles
173,"January 14, 2022",Fantastic!!!
174,"January 11, 2022",Best high and taste.
175,"November 25, 2021",Love this pod‚Äî one of the stronger stiiizy indicas I‚Äôve tried. Good for night/sleep and pain relief.
176,"November 17, 2021","Depending on the mood, this strain can either make you forget about the long day at work or help you get the mind juices flowing.  But even with the mind going everywhere can be asleep in mid thought in moments"
177,"November 6, 2021",Good
178,"October 30, 2021","The king is here! By far one of my favorite strains, STIZZY does good by this strain by hitting you hard and quick leaving you open for either deep thoughts or mindless jokes and riffs to do with your favorite group of people. I don't get harsh munchies but I definitely feel this one for a lot longer than other strains. King Louis is a fantastic choice for a sesh with the squad or just watching your favorite videos at home."
179,"October 3, 2021",Amazing strain to rest the mind and body
180,"September 3, 2021",My favorite indica vape. A proper high with great flavor.
181,"August 13, 2021",Best flavor!
182,"August 1, 2021",I love indicas and this is my favorite pod for late nights in my room while readin(c definitely gives you a relaxing body high. 10/10
183,"July 2, 2021","I love the strong mango flavor, it gets me high every time."
184,"June 7, 2021",Love the service.
185,"May 26, 2021",This is hands down the best tasting indica from stizzy. It‚Äôs a straight mango taste very sweet and a little sour I thought it was a sativa for a second given that‚Äôs how they all taste. If you want flavor this is it
186,"May 26, 2021",It does its job
187,"April 27, 2021","I lived in LA when they dropped this product from their original store, it is my favorite and will always be, no one can compete with this company."
188,"April 12, 2021",King Louis exceeded my expectations. I like the flavor and the high. Really helped me chill.
189,"March 27, 2021",Best tasting pod and the high was great too
190,"February 18, 2021",Didn‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs to fruity
191,"February 6, 2021",Very tasty and potent
192,"January 9, 2021",Good value
193,"December 27, 2020",I really enjoy the relaxing mood I get from this stiiizy pod and how it helps me relax will definitely buy more and I do and the taste is great.
194,"December 19, 2020","Not the Stiiizy for me. Was mostly only good for sleep relief. I found very little 'high' to it, It just made me tired. The mango flavor was nice, but the cart itself was not completely full, a large bubble on the right side. That and the limited high, I had to mark this one down a bit."
195,"June 12, 2023",My favorite Stiiizy strain ü•¥
196,"June 2, 2023",Gives a crazy head high. Loved it
197,"April 10, 2023",One of my all time favorite flavors!
198,"January 31, 2023","First time using Stiizy pods,  I must say I really did like this one, flavor was decent but i dont get them for the flavor just an added bonus.  That being said I enjoyed Gelato, but the high didnt seem to last very long but I guess that could be me and building up a resistance to it sadly... Overall, I liked this product, Didnt have any leaks, and so far so good.    You will get a tingle body high or well I did, pain free I must say which is always nice and what I use this for, so will..."
199,"January 15, 2023","Decided to try this brand, initially the pods were great, but after a few uses the PODS leak into your mouth and get jammed up. I purchases  2 at once, 1st one that leaked I exchanged. The new one I received and the previous one I had...ALL LEAKED and left me chocking a wad of oil."
200,"December 27, 2022",I only go for potency the higher the THC lvl is what I care about & what I'm after. I do not give a F about terps. Gelato is usually one of the highest testing carts & I like the strain.
201,"December 14, 2022",Great for relaxing
202,"August 25, 2022",Great high
203,"June 16, 2022",Taste was ok and high was ok. Rather go with CDT's for the high
204,"May 14, 2022",Great product  Great price
205,"May 2, 2022",Still a great pod years later
206,"February 8, 2022",Honestly this pod looks used. I‚Äôve never had an issue with any pod I‚Äôve ordered but this one is clear with dark brown air bubbles almost as if someone had already taken some hits.
207,"December 14, 2021",Yummy
208,"September 24, 2021","Amazing taste, a good mix for a hybrid. All the feels without the munchies."
209,"August 13, 2021",I would definitely recommend this flavor .
210,"June 5, 2021",Good flavor and high
211,"May 22, 2021",These Pods are amazing. TEAM stiiizy#1
212,"May 12, 2021","Good high, natural taste. One of my favorite pods"
213,"March 28, 2021",Pretty chill
214,"December 11, 2020","Not the best tasting but did it‚Äôs job, fell right asleep"
215,"November 8, 2020",great strain
216,"June 5, 2020",This pod leaked immediately and I barely got any use from it before it emptied itself. Very disappointed.
217,"June 3, 2020",Gelato pax pod is very fire .
218,"May 11, 2020","Kind of disappointed with this strain, had higher expectations for a lasting high! I felt relaxed but never high stimulated! Almost like vaping a cbd distillate"
219,"April 24, 2020",Definitely a hybrid type effect. Small head high and more of a body high. Taste was not my favorite but still enjoyable.
220,"April 21, 2020","Local Stiiizy lover Jodie back with another top tier flavor!!! Gelato has always been a frozen treat and nothing shows this better than the treat you experience from smoking a Gelato Stiiizy. After about 5 rips into that bad boy I could feel calm and a small euphoria which is always amazing. Overall a sweet tasting strain with a punch, stay safe and blaze on üòé"
221,"November 27, 2019",The only thing that I didnt care for was the taste of the gelato. But over than that it's one of my favorite strains.
222,"September 10, 2023",The best tasting flavor so far that I have tried.
223,"August 6, 2023",Honestly didn‚Äôt feel much from this.
224,"July 30, 2023",Amazing taste & wonderful high
225,"July 14, 2023","While it's smooth, it tastes like I'm vaping grape Kool-Aid powder. As an all-day smoker, the taste quickly became overbearing and unpleasant. This product feels like it was developed for twelve-year-olds, not adults. 

It's a nice a relaxing buzz, but too much leaves me feeling agitated. There are better strains out there for me. Blue Burst is ideal for anyone who habitually snorted Pixi Stix as a child."
226,"June 23, 2023",yummy flavor never disappoints
227,"June 8, 2023",Blue burst from stiizy tastes great. It tastes like grape pixie sticks. The feeling is smooth and very relaxing. As a hybrid you expect a little sativa and indica but this one is mainly indica feeling without the feeling of sleepiness. Definitely recommend this flavor over other flavors.
228,"May 13, 2023",Michigan is more affordable. Suck it Pritzkers
229,"April 12, 2023",Good product!
230,"March 12, 2023","If you like cheap gas station vapes that taste like a stale sugar free gummy bear, then you will love this. I spent $112 just to throw this directly in the trash. I don't even think there is any THC in this because there is not even the slightest bit of essence of marijuana. I knew as soon as I opened it and smelled the nasty fruit smell that I was not going to like this, I tried to do an even exchange for a pure strain in the same brand and was told no so I tried one hit and couldn't even..."
231,"February 24, 2023",The bud was good I used it to relax
232,"February 14, 2023",Worked really well for numbing my back pain and helping me just chill out.
233,"February 13, 2023",Taste profile ebbs and flows. Some are alright...others taste like drinking a bottle of bubbles from the dollar store.
234,"February 4, 2023","All Stiiizy products are super tasty, high quality & very effective~!"
235,"December 10, 2022",Ok
236,"November 22, 2022",The product lasted for a while. Literally tasted like a blue jolly rancher. Recommend for helping you finish those last minute papers.
237,"October 18, 2022",Pleasant with an indica slant to it.
238,"October 12, 2022",Definitely Great Taste &&Feeling. Love it !
239,"September 12, 2022","Yes, very much so"
240,"September 2, 2022",awesome flavor
241,"July 23, 2022",Blue Burst is my favorite of all the Stiiizy flavors!
242,"June 7, 2022",Favorite flavor so far.  Great high and taste good.
243,"April 16, 2022",it has a very fruity taste and has a nice high
244,"April 8, 2022",Wish the pod itself worked better!  Many defective
245,"March 16, 2022","Taste like a blue starburst, great high too"
246,"February 24, 2022","My blue burst pod was a dud, this isn‚Äôt a bad thing but made me realize, if your pod doesn‚Äôt work, keep your receipt and head back same day, D2 employees will gladly help you out (same day) 
The flavor is super strong and taste like a refreshing spoonful of blueberries, it‚Äôs a distillate oil pod with a great taste and a high that hits right in the head, the taste and strong high of course, makes this worth buying in a gram pod, pick this up with a blue battery and rep that BLUEBERRY STIIIZY! ü´êü´ê"
247,"January 28, 2022",The high is good but I don't like the taste
248,"December 29, 2021","It was new packaging and I feel like it went quicker than the other ones. But other than that, it still tastes good."
249,"December 26, 2021","I don‚Äôt know if Stiiizy changed something up recently but 1. This doesn‚Äôt taste as good as blue burst has for me in the past just by a little and 
2. The oil seems thicker, longer lasting. I‚Äôm happy!"
250,"December 5, 2021","Great taste, almost like a grape/blue raspberry flavor. Would buy again."
251,"December 4, 2021",Not that great but not bad either. Probably wouldn't buy again.
252,"November 5, 2021",Great taste and good pod to use while getting tasks done around the house or needing an extra boost for creativity !!
253,"November 3, 2021",good (-:

258,"June 16, 2021","Really liked blue burst, very tasty would get again"
259,"June 10, 2021","Overall good, tasty. First time trying a Stiiizy product. Battery and set up is  easy and discreet. Sometimes it seems to get plugged up."
260,"May 26, 2021",Loved it! It's my go to.
261,"May 26, 2021",My favorite
262,"April 29, 2021",Very tasty. Blue raspberry taste wise. Worked as advertised lol
263,"April 26, 2021",Love my stiiizy
264,"March 28, 2021",Great
265,"January 22, 2021",Best flavor I have tried yet!!
266,"January 4, 2021",One of my favorite flavors! very smooth refreshing taste
267,"December 27, 2020","Description of product says ‚Äúblue Gummy‚Äù bu when I got the package it said ‚Äúblue raspberry‚Äù ? Idk it might be just me, but the taste reminds Me of the Old school ‚ÄúFlinstones‚Äù Vitamins you would find in your grandmas medicine cabinet ."
268,"December 12, 2020",my favorite flavor so far
269,"December 10, 2020",Great taste and terps but doesn‚Äôt get you too high. Idk just my experience.
270,"December 7, 2020","Purchased the 1g cartridge. Not much of anything, almost as if it was on the low-low end of some form of dosage."
271,"November 7, 2020",Not as strong of a high I was looking for but it did ease my mind and made me really chill. The flavor is pretty good too.
272,"October 9, 2020","Very nice, even high as described. Would purchase again!"
273,"October 2, 2020",My favorite stizzy flavor
274,"August 5, 2020",Product was amazing. Tastes so good
275,"August 5, 2020",Great tasting product with even better results. Perfect one for me to do the job and keep me active.
276,"July 27, 2020",This was my 1st try with this hybrid. It's nice. It actually was quite helpful with some digestion issues I had. Knocked the nausea out fast. I appreciated that greatly. The flavor has a slightly odd aftertaste. I'd call the true flavor 'burnt raspberry'.
277,"July 25, 2020",TASTED FIRE
278,"June 23, 2020",Tastes nice :)
279,"April 27, 2020",tastes like skittles or blueberry gummy
280,"April 17, 2020","this flavor is very tasty in my opinion, one of the best tasting stiiizy ive tried so far, goes well with an energy drink"
281,"April 3, 2020",BERRY GOOD STUFF...ENJOY
282,"September 8, 2023","Great Strain , Definitely will enjoy lots"
283,"July 1, 2023",Blue dream is my favorite üòç.   Great taste & effect!
284,"May 1, 2023",This cartridge got me in a place that I could enjoy.
285,"April 14, 2023",Taste is too strong and smoke is harsh. Stays charged longer than lime though
286,"October 28, 2022",Product was great in making me relaxed. Only complaint about this vape pen is that it gets clogged from time to time. I would buy more but it‚Äôs a real bummer when you try to activate the vape pen and it‚Äôs clogged.
287,"June 19, 2022","This was a great disposal pen no charging ever need good consistently till the end!
My new favorite!! Will buy again."
288,"June 16, 2022",Didn‚Äôt know if I would repurchase a stiiizy so I started with a disposable starter pen. It worked out for me because I ended up decided to buy a battery and pods for the stiiizy.
289,"June 9, 2022","An amazing strain. Smooth and delicious! Definitely works wonders if you microdose throughout the day. Convenient and easy to use, would definitely recommend 10/10 every time I‚Äôve used it!"
290,"March 26, 2022",Great flavor. Super clean distilled vape. Stiiizy does a great job distilling and keeping high thc levels. Highly recommend trying any Stiiizy product.
291,"March 2, 2022",Got a great buzz from this one
292,"February 10, 2022",It was all good but it stopped working for me mid way through
293,"December 5, 2020",Taste is an 8 high is a 6ish l was high but wanted to be higher.....but it last pretty long only use it during emergencies. This pen makes me want to explore other vapes
294,"May 6, 2020",I love Blue Dream and the stiizy pen hits.
295,"April 4, 2020",Did not like the flavor yet enjoyed the mood.
