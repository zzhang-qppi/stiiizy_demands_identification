61,3/4 of these pens are defective,1 star,"I have purchased 3 defective pens from stiiizy, successfully exchanged 1. After the headache of the first exchange I just said F**** it and ate the next. As a medical patient, this really sucks. It took over a month to deal with customer service, and ended with my bank stepping in because of stiiizys bad business. unbelievable.

64,The best for a discreet yet stylish high,5.0 stars,"Honestly as a parent at times you need something to help you decompress. As the kids became older it became harder to explain why mommy and daddy had to take walks outside in turns to ""get some air"". These have become out life savers. Get some nice relaxation in, all without smelling. We still take our walks to get air BUT these hit so hard that it only takes a few minutes outside and no mess! Love you Stiz","January 23, 2019"
65,Rose Gold Everything,5.0 stars,"But seriously, besides being absolutely adorable, this pen is perfect! I’m super clumsy and am constantly dropping my vape pens. Several times I’ve broken a full cartridge, but with this design, it’s really difficult to drop it at an angle that would break. It’s also lightweight and discreet, it’s small/ slim enough to fit in even small pockets or a wallet. Another problem I’ve encountered with other pens is having to replace the batteries more times than I can count because the plate get pushed into the battery over time from over tightening when charging or connecting cartridges, but again, this design allows you to just drop the cartridge in, and it charges like a phone, solving both issues. I love it!","August 28, 2018"
66,I love it!!!,5.0 stars,"I love how it looks with my freshly done manicure, I love how it looks when its just sitting on my counter, I love how it looks ALWAYS!!

69,ADORBS,5.0 stars,"couldn’t wait to come back to LA & get my first STIIZY. & of course I wanted the rose gold, so sleek & lady like. I have no plans to go back to other pens that i’ve used in the past. only thing i would possible want is a case? something small & compact that I can put it in to protect it while it’s in my bag. other than that, i am sold! customer for life 🙌🏽","May 23, 2019"

71,"Great pod battery, very nice color",5.0 stars,"So, as for a general review of the battery, it's really good! It has a nice, discreet form factor, superb build quality, a battery that lasts for a good while and the pods fit perfectly into their slot and look very sleek. It works great with all Stiiizy pods, even the live resins. Now, as for the color, it's a very nice pastel pink with a smooth, matte metal surface. It's a really nice, calming color that's also a bit easier to find when you're looking your battery to take another hit.","July 23, 2021"

90,Glad I went with this one 😍,5.0 stars,I was having a bit of a hard time trying to decide which color to get. I thought I had picked the rose gold at the counter but I'm not trippin cos I really like this color and I'm happy even if it was a mistake cos this one is perfect...the purple seemed s bit too bright and the rose gold not girly/pink enough for what I was looking for. Perfect shade of pink because it's pretty discrete and is overall just a very classy color. Super lightweight so I can see how people tend to loose their pens really easily especially if you're hi af 😂 Glad I ended up picking up s stiiizy system cos (so far) I'm very happy with it since I also got it on Saturday when the batteries and pods are 20% off so it was $60 for the battery and 2 .5 gram pods 👍,"June 15, 2020"
91,,5.0 stars,"I quite like the stiiizy system. The carts taste better than a lot of 510 carts ive tried, although there are tons of brands that make 510 carts vs only 1 for stiiizy. The pros of this are that every stiiizy cart you buy will be pretty good because they all are made by the same company and that company happens to be pretty good. Another pro is that the carts arent too pricey, but this varies depending on where you are and what dispensary you are shopping at. The last pro ive noticed is that the stiiizy carts seem to last a long time, idk if its because a lot of 510 thread carts are under filled or something, but i got a half gram stiiizy cart to start out and i have been hitting it non stop and it has easily lasted a longer time than all 510 half gram carts ive ever had. And it looks like its still half full. The cons of this product are that there is only one brand that makes carts, so if the quality starts to drop then you cant just switch brands and keep using this battery.","April 17, 2020"

123,Disappointing,2.0 stars,"I have been using batteries for years and this was my First Stiizy purchase. I am SO DISAPPOINTED with this particular battery, the magnets used to hold the Hella expensive pods are WEAK!! The first day I had it I stored it in my bra, this is where I put all of my batteries when I don't have pockets. Anyways, ran several errands and when I pulled the battery out to hit it. There was NO pod attached, It had fallen off and I didn't even notice!!!!! $50 gone!! Come on Stiizy, this is a joke. The quality of the oil is hands down Bomb asf BUT for their price you need to do Better with the batteries!!!! I have another brand of battery and the magnetic is so Strong that I've NEVER lost a cart or even have it come detached from the battery even after dropping several times. I'm now a little uneasy about buying more pods for fear of them falling off. I don't have money to be throwing away. PLEASE Stiizy, do better and change the Structure and Quality of the batteries.","February 22, 2022"
124,The battery doesn’t work,1 star,The battery will charge red and show it being dead but after the 45-60 minute time period it will still be dead and won’t even turn on white when hitting with pod,"November 12, 2022"
125,Great battery cute colors,5.0 stars,"It’s a nice battery I like how it charges with an android charger so if it dies on me I can get ahold of a charger pretty easy, easier than it would be if it was the standard 510 thread charger .

The charging port is an android charger which is very convenient. The cart is magnetic which I also like. I still have my “can” pen since I haven’t been able to find another brands making carts for stizzy pens. My tender hooked me up with a nice Stizzy bag and lanyard. The lanyard came with a stizzy pen rubber holder so I don’t lose my pen, which apparently happens since they’re so slim and small. Maybe a find my pen app? Need help contact me.","April 30, 2019"
152,good buy,4.0 stars,low key they hi key pens just wish battery lasted longer,"June 16, 2019"
153,Cool design,3.0 stars,"Great design. It feels awesome in my hand. But, invest in this only when you are ready to leave all others behind. 510 threads are everywhere, making them very easy to switch and try new varieties. The pod is better preforming, but limited to certain brands. So, are you a Stiizy person? I am not a brand person, because each oil brand has given me both positive and negative experiences, so I like to shop around. With this battery, I can only buy their products. That would be cool if their product was premium, but even the bud tender suggested a different brand. I just had to try it for myself.... it’s not premium, it just tastes great. Now I have a battery that I might never use again, unless I decide to give your oil another chance.","December 10, 2019"

155,looks nice,2.0 stars,got one on the first of the month what I like about it is that it's small and easy to hit my biggest complaint about the pin is that I have to charge it every other day and on top of that the cartridge I got witch was hard core og don't taste good at all to further note that all of my other pins that I have I can smoke a full gram before I have to charge them what's up with that,"November 04, 2019"

179,stizzy,4.0 stars,"love mine i should’ve purchased sooner, hits well and carts are affordable. bad thing is that it seems like it does go through carts quite a bit faster than a regular 510 battery does. shouldve got the orange or any bright color instead tho bc it blends in with everything so i lose this one all the time😂","March 29, 2020"
180,You know my STIIIZY!,5.0 stars,"Poor rating for the batteries yall. Just take care of your batteries. Keep your rubber tops for the bottom of your batteries as well as for the top and bottom of your carts ya digg!? Lord knows how much crap can end up in pockets. Don't OVERCHARGE! It doesn't take long sheesh. Been rockin 2 black batteries since. Now I'm rockin the Rose w/ the black lanyard. My next one is going to be a Red battery for my Sats! Fasho! The finish on these batteries are so amazingly done. I might just get a blue one for those evening Indies. Cant hurt to have back ups. They normally last me a couple days before I have to recharge. Brids are on the Rose and on the rise. Ha ha! .... Sorry I had to do it... It's about color coding too people. On the carts I use red, green, and purple sharpies to fill in the lines but for the most part my tastebuds know my favorite kines. You know what would be dope tho is if the lines where color coded red, green, or purple. JGEAH! You know my STIIIZ!","August 17, 2018"
181,Second Helping,5.0 stars,I bought a blue one a week ago and have had that time to use it every day. I’ve been researching different strains and flavors and just ordered more cartridges and a second [red] Stiiizy battery as a backup/spare. I love the gentle hits I can take and I feel like I can better control my dosing. Happy,"April 29, 2019"
182,Beautifully convenient,5.0 stars,"This pen is so slick and portable I take this thing everywhere. I still live by other cartridge, wax, etc. pens, but this makes the vaping so effortless. The pods can switch instantly, they attach to the pen magnetically. The pen itself is only on when you breathe thru it, no buttons. The pods seem to last quite a while, don't need to breathe in long to get a decent hit. 10/10 my dude","August 05, 2018"

226,good hits bad battery life,4.0 stars,i have to say it hits really really nice almost fells like inhaling nothing even when doing a blinker but the battery does not last very long even when just doing straight pulls [not a blinker] it dies rather quickly so make sure to charge before going to a sesh or when you ride solo other than that it is a great battery would fully recommended,"August 08, 2021"
227,good with its moments,4.0 stars,"a good battery, it hits well and i feel like i get a good hit even when it’s almost dead. it does seem to die fast or maybe i don’t charge it long enough. also if you leave your cartridge on while charging it does waste a little bit of it so be aware of that. but i like the one guys idea of having a few batteries for the different strains so i might do that","June 04, 2021"

231,Worst vape I’ve bought,1 star,"I bought this vape and 3 pods, it was great for a day or two but after that every pod I dropped into the battery started to leak into my mouth and then eventually just forced itself out of the pod on its own. I never charged it with a pod in place and always left it in the upright position. I do not recommend this product for the price of the pods especially if they just leak everywhere.","June 23, 2021"
232,Bummed out,1 star,"so I purchased two batteries, one for my girl and I. I love the thing they're really low key and great on the go when you just trying to sneak a toke. Unfortunately, my battery went out 8 days later. Lights won't turn on or charge.. sucks man..","January 02, 2021"
233,Not all that.,1 star,"I have been using my Stiizy for 4 months now, and am about to put it down for good. Body: the body of the battery looks very sleek, but it's surface is slippery and hard to hold onto. Combined with how thin and light it is (cheap aluminum construction) the included lanyard is necessary. The lanyard is honestly the best part. Performance: for a proprietary product, it leaves a lot to be desired. It has consistent connection issues between the battery and the cartridges no matter how clean the contact points are. Over time this becomes a consistent problem. The carts also clog very easily. For every three hits I take It having to unclog it and it is really frustrating. Add to that the carts seem to be very inconsistent but mostly on the weak side, and it makes this one to avoid.","November 09, 2021"
234,Disappointed,1 star,I bought the red stiiizy pen and a week later it stopped charging out of nowhere. Don’t know what happen to it just stopped charging. Do you know the problem or what could of happen?,"August 08, 2018"

238,a Review coming from 4th Dimension.,5.0 stars,"Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaa! No more sneaking out on the room and go to the bar and open the cabinet under the sink and reach further just to get the lens box and pick a flower and grind it then pipe it then go outside to smoke 5 times and go hide it again and go to restroom and drink a glass of listerine just to elimanate the smells and go back to the room and get to bed. While gf asleep. But this one is awsome! I’ll tell her I’m just go wee-wee, then open the sink cabinet and reach underneath to grab the pen w/ velcro and smoke 3 times, no smell all good go back to bed. From 30mins to 3mins. Brooo wtf!! I’m flyyyyyyiiingggggggggg! Ultimate Mind Blown. Life saver! And Time Saver!!! Stiizyyy is the best!!!","February 20, 2019"
239,RENAME THE PRODUCT FOR FUCKS SAKE,5.0 stars,Starter kit sounds like its a WHOLE set up. VERY MISLEADING FOR ALOT OF PATIENTS. Whats so hard about calling it a battery on the box.. GEEZ,"July 22, 2018"
240,Totally Worth it moisture makes it “leak”,5.0 stars,"After a few uses it pays for itself, people claiming it leaks have to realize their salvia has to go somewhere, right? Make sure your lips are dry and your cart won’t “leak”. I assumed it leaked as well however moisture does travel I like the design it’s sleek and discreet. Awesome magnetic 🧲 snap on pods that tastes great and clean. For only around 25 bucks depending on your dispensary you get a cool, quick charging, automatic puff detection; no need to hold down a button because the way it works is simple yet very efficient, you simply “puff” away and it lights down to let you know when it’s time to be charged. Very fast minimal charging time, decent battery life for the small physical size of the battery. Overall a good product from an awesome company that is setting the new standard for quality.","January 26, 2019"
241,if you're going through a pod in a day wow,5.0 stars,this thing is amazing. if you're going through a pod in a day wow get a life or a job. I can't believe somone would suck on it all day thrn complain it doesn't last.,"March 09, 2018"
242,defective battery,5.0 stars,"Love the battery. It's not as resilient as I would like - had one break because the two contacts inside the battery seemed to fail and no longer cobust the product. STIIIZY support was awesome and got me another battery replacement from my delivery guy. They reached out and contacted the business to get it set up. I love the look of the product, great overall design.","January 04, 2018"
243,Was all about this brand but,5.0 stars,"The plastic is cheap. Once you get past the wow phase of the sleek design the problems come to the surface. Battery dies faster than any pen I’ve dealt with, 3 or 4 pulls and you can feel the tip getting so hot that sometimes it even spits the oil onto your tongue and this thing is a magician, your pod can be gone in a day and a half not even at times. Cool design, definitely needs a lot of work. I wouldn’t suggest this without doing your own research cause everyone else would have you believe its godsend but in my honest opinion after buying 20-25 I’m done. Unless they redesign the pods I won’t be coming back","March 08, 2018"
244,So Far So Good,5.0 stars,"I LOVE that the pod isn't glass because I have dropped it 3 times so far. It hits hard and very smoothly and a little goes a long way. In my area most places seem to sell it, and everyone has been out of the Plug Play, so I finally decided to give it a try. I am happy with it overall. This unit is physically lighter and a bit sleeker than the Plug Play, and doesn't require you to push a button to hit, but I feel like the hits are slightly harsher with the Stiiizy. With both I'm a bit leery of having a battery than can ONLY be used with ONE company's cartridge bc if they suddenly go out of business/stop producing quality products/raise their prices 400%/piss me off somehow, than I have invested in something I won't be able to use. Having said that, I have been very pleased with both thus far, and while I don't think Stiiizy is AS amazing as the hype suggested, the quality, style, and ease of use have won me over. A price decrease wouldn't go amiss though... 😜","March 18, 2019"
245,A dream come true,5.0 stars,"If you're like me you been smoking a while you tried pre-rolls edibles things like that and they didn't cut it. This is the Solution right here, man. Charge the battery the ""Pen"", the STIIIZY for a couple hours and make sure to stock up during the sales at your local Dispensary, the PODS are addictingly good and hit every time. More expensive but way worth it. You could buy like four or five pre-rolls and still not get as high as these pens. All you really need is a few hits and you'll be ready to rock n roll a","September 03, 2020"
246,Better than pax for affordable price,5.0 stars,Figured it was worth the 20 dollar gamble on the battery and 30 (at my shop) for pod was worth the gamble for something portable and discreet... I was very happy to find it went above and beyond my expectations. As a hater of vape products and a skeptic of the content quality /quality of builds I have to say I’m impressed. May have even changed my opinion on vapes.. actually feels like a dab and battery lasts a min. Very pleased.,"December 16, 2017"

269,Stiiiiiizy,5.0 stars,These batteries are great. Super convenient and the pods pack a punch. Hopefully they become more available across other services as it’s occasional hard to come by if the few places in the area are low on stock.

In my line of work I needed something discrete but still cool, and honestly ever since I stumbled upon Stiizy I've been a fan. I have tried plenty of flavors and the one that is currently in my poclet is biscotti I'm all over any indica that can help me through the day, and if needed take me to that place we all want to be at. you're welcome. and #StayStiiizy","March 17, 2018"

421,Great pod killed by battery!,5.0 stars,"Hello, I’ve had two pods one battery. Neither pod was smoked properly. Imagine hyperventilating on a pod thinking this time it’s going to work! You inhale a puff, hold it a beat and exhale.repeat this process 10 times. You may hit 3 puffs of product. All 10 inhalation goes to your head. I’m I buzzed??? YOU bet. Not from the medication. I’m light headed from those 10 attempts. Moreover, I noticed the oil has been sucked out of the top holes!! OMG now the pod is sticky with oil. My lips have a thick oil slathered on them too. I needed dawn dish soap to wipe this oil off me and the pod. In the end, I liked the oil but the damn battery is killing the whole experience of the pod. Why would Stiiizy allow that to occur? Someone better get to working on those growing image problem before it goes viral. All the good hits taken by the lucky can not offset the voices of an unfulfilled medication experience had by the not so lucky.","July 02, 2018"

442,Awesome for Beginners to Experts,4.8 stars,Ive been vaping for a while and needed a new battery.I decidedly try STIIIZY even though they have propiatary pods you have to use. As it turnet they are the best I’ve ever had! Surprised me. I bought the starter kit and 2 different pods. Easily best so fa for real true flavor and a great effect. Awesome taste. Zero pesticides! See if anybody else has that!They did dry my mouth out pretty bad. Only negative.Going to try all the flavors they have. Well worth it.,"April 30, 2018"
443,One of he best pens out there,4.7 stars,"Loved it, tends to go by fast if I don't have anything to do, the perfect travel pen. Easy to conceal and rips fat off a fresh cart. Can be a bit pricy compared to flower but on the go it can't be beat!","April 20, 2018"
444,The broken battery and Stiizy’s customer service,4.0 stars,I recently had to replace the Stiizy battery that broke after 6 weeks gentle use. The store manager did not want to deal with my problem so she said there was nothing she could do. I ended up contacting Stiizy customer service and they helped me right away. I submitted photos of my broken battery and Stiizy’s customer service arranged for a swap out of my old broken battery. Now I have a functioning battery. Thanks Stiizy,"June 12, 2018"
445,Hardest hitting pen I’ve used,4.0 stars,"Stiiizy checks all the boxes for me - discreet, packs a punch, tastes great, doesn’t cost too much. Been using it consistently for months now with pretty much no issues aside from getting a fake pod every now and then. Only thing I could ask for is a better battery life, I find myself charging it a lot.","March 25, 2019"
446,"Yes, I still Love my Stiiizi",4.0 stars,"I’ve had the same battery for years and never had a never a problem with a pod either. Stiiizi was my first try at a pen and I did abandon it to try other new supposed to be better pens more than once, but I always go back to the Stiiiz. I think their product is good and if it wasn’t, I don’t feel they’d still be around. Stoners & Cannabis aficionados alike would support the company if the product wasn’t true.","November 13, 2019"

452,My Favorite,4.0 stars,This is my favorite wax pen to use. Just wish the pod wasn’t plastic. Once the pod gets near finished I can start tasting plastic.. but I get hella high after 🤣,"March 20, 2019"
453,Good Little Vape,4.0 stars,Nice little pod system. The oils are hella tasty. The 0.5 pods are perfect. The 1.0 pods clog all the time. The battery charges and fires nicely.,"December 11, 2018"
454,"Good, but...",4.0 stars,"3.5 stars would be more accurate, but I'm rounding up because I love Stiiizy. I like how discrete the pen is, but it doesn't have much power to it. Also, the magnets don't hold the pods super well. But with that being said, I definitely recommend this pen anyway!","December 07, 2022"
455,ok at best,4.0 stars,gave 4 stars bc it did hit properly but wasn't as good as hyped up to be,"September 05, 2021"

459,love it,4.0 stars,"I love it over all everything is great, I only wish they had more of a selection. Also the second time I charged my battery the hit was alot harsher than the first time. idk if I messed the battery up or if by some chance I turned the voltage up. but besides that it was great!","October 07, 2019"

461,"Decent, But on it's way out the door",4.0 stars,"Stiiizy is a decent brand, they have a lot of marketing and dedicated patients, but I feel like they need to step up their game. The oil quality is great, but they should branch out a bit more","April 21, 2019"
462,Best vape pen in the market,4.0 stars,Stiiitzy I'm coming for you,"August 20, 2018"
463,"Great idea, very poor quality",3.7 stars,"I purchased my first Stiiizy and pod exactly a week ago on May 16th after a buddy of mine recommended them over the generic threaded cartridges. At first I noticed that the draw seemed clogged but it would hit after quite a bit of effort. After looking it up on google I figured I got a defective pod so I went and bought a replacement pod and it was still hitting the same. I transferred the pods to my buddies Stiiizy battery and the draw was great. Once you hit the Stiiizy until the light blinks it feels like you took a dab off rig. I contacted the vendor whom I bought it from and he said it was a matter to discuss with Stiiizy themselves and referred me to their website. Im waiting to hear back from them but I’ll update this review once I do but after looking reading reviews on separate websites it seems this is a common issue. Overall, it’s a potent, discreet, well-designed product when it works","May 23, 2018"
464,Great pen but was let down,3.0 stars,"Bought my pen 9days ago. Everything was perfect hit great perfect amount of smoke, nice smooth draws, but then I had to charge it and that’s where it went bad. Hooked it up and came back to get about an hour later when I tried to disconnect it the whole casing came off exposing the wires while it was still connected and charging. It slid back on but now nothing won’t draw won’t work. Super bummed. Shouldn’t of had this experience within 9days of purchasing it!","April 25, 2019"
465,Man...,3.0 stars,"I love stiizy pods for the experience, accessibility and convenience of pricing but these damn batteries are always going out on me. At least three newish batteries wouldn’t charge anymore. I shouldn’t have to fix them for a long while if at all.","January 08, 2021"
466,am I high yet? *Sigh*,3.0 stars,Clean look but the cartridge wiggles bc weak magnets keep it in. Wish I got a PAX,"May 20, 2019"
467,Very clean design,3.0 stars,I like the idea of the pen but the cart wiggles and becomes annoying LOL FIX,"July 30, 2020"
468,slight issues but works great,3.0 stars,love the discreetness but I found that the cartridge likes to separate from the battery so I'm constantly pushing the two back together in order for it to work,"January 30, 2021"
469,Eh,3.0 stars,When I first got the stiiizy i was so excited for it but the pods tend to leak towards the end. Im not too happy with this product but the actual wax is bomb af strawnana is my favorite,"January 07, 2019"

471,Awesome,3.0 stars,This is the1 you been waiting for!..,"February 07, 2020"
472,No fat clouds.,3.0 stars,Don’t know if it’s just the one I got but long story short is.....no fat clouds unless you take blinkers. I just felt like I had to inhale much harder than I had to with this one. The pods hit a lot better with the advance big battery kit so just spend the extra bucks if that’s what your looking for.,"July 21, 2019"

476,Great but inconsistent hits,3.0 stars,"Had issues with my battery. Wouldn’t work consistently, would have to swap the cartridge out. It was kinda like a Nintendo cartridge, I’d have to take it out and blow on it then put it back in for it to work.","April 17, 2018"
477,Gooood,3.0 stars,"These are some of the best cartridges I have tried m, with that being said the battery wasn’t every durable I had it for 3 pods and I struggle to get a hit out of it even if the battery is fully charged","March 17, 2018"
478,Battery life,3.0 stars,Maybe an hour definitely wish it would last longer. First day I used it was full charge and I hit it once and 30-40 min later I went to actually use it and it was dead. Definitely need a portable on you all the time. Took it to Disneyland and still had to have it charging in my pocket when I wasn’t using it.,"March 02, 2018"
479,Broken vaporizer,2.5 stars,I purchased this battery six weeks ago and one of the internal connections snapped off after 3 uses. The darn thing wasn’t even dropped. I took it back to the shop and the staff refused to do anything about it. Ended up buying another battery to finish the pods that I have. I’ll see how long this battery lasts.,"May 16, 2018"
480,Worst pen waste of money,2.2 stars,Been wanting to try stiizy because i been hearing so much about it. bought the pen 1st and bought a biscotti cart couple days later. So 1st off the pen does not come charged its completely dead which was odd because every battery i buy is always somewhat charged when i buy it. 2nd when i charge it fully and try to pull for a hit it constantly keeps blinking red/white and not allowing me to hit it. I keep looking up trouble shooting for this issue and seeing if anyone else experienced this issue but i cant find anything. Really disappointed about this because the whole set up is 50$ and i cant even use it nor return it. Very upset about this i’ll stick to ye old brass knuckles with a normal ass battery that actually works,"April 10, 2018"
481,Pods leaking,2.0 stars,"Unfortunately, the last two pods I have had has leaked when the pods were about half full. Anyone else is having this issue? When inhaling, sometimes the liquid will end in my mouth, it only happens when the pods are half way done.","February 15, 2019"
482,Short Battery Life,2.0 stars,"My battery lasted about 3 weeks before completely going dead, more specifically no longer accepting charge! I have a brand new pod I can’t even hit, not cool!! Disappointing for sure... I Should’ve gone with a less expensive threaded battery. 2 stars ONLY BECAUSE it’s fun while it lasts... :/","October 15, 2020"
483,Didn’t get me that high,2.0 stars,"First of all they hype is in really this pen didn’t get me super stoned. It’s just a chill kind of high, I would like a refund for this to be honest.","April 17, 2020"
484,I Don't get the Hype,2.0 stars,I’ve had a lot of wax pens and this one by far is my least favorite.,"November 19, 2019"
485,Decent but poor quality,2.0 stars,hits smooth and never burns but the magnets fell out after a week. once that happens the pen is useless bc it cant hold the pods without the magnets.,"February 08, 2018"
486,Doesn’t hit at all,2.0 stars,I’ve cleared half of a sour diesel pod and 2 hours later it still hasn’t hit I smoke a lot but there should still be something,"July 01, 2019"
487,Plug Play is far better,2.0 stars,This isn’t nearly as strong as PP. My friend used Stiizy and he’s been a pothead since he was a kid so he’s got a super high tolerance. My PP kit blew him away in two hits.,"March 04, 2019"
488,Disapointing,2.0 stars,"As ""normal"" as it looks, the hits are very airy and it doesn't give me the feeling of getting a hit nor the taste. I give it 2 ☆'s because it is discrete looking.","May 11, 2020"

491,Magnets suck,2.0 stars,I just bought my battery on Thursday and I was finally able to open it yesterday and try it turns out the magnet that connects with the cartridge is weak compared fo my brothers that has a stronger hold. Im pretty annoyed!!,"February 26, 2019"
492,stiiizy defective,1.3 stars,I bought mine yesterday and mine doesn't work. it's fully charged but whenever I put in a cartridge it blinks red. am I doing something wrong or is it the battery?,"April 04, 2018"
493,Are you guys all just that high?!,1 star,"Lmfao!!! Everytime I hear about how the pod didn't last or it burned or leaked lol. NO PEOPLE! STIIIZY IS selling you .325 of a gram and calling it a half and if you buy the ""1 gram"" your only getting .75 of a gram!!! Wtf are you guys supporting these thieves for?? Left coast extracts and west coast cure pods both fit the stiiizy battery and bigger bang for your buck!!! Trust me im in the middle of a false advertisement claim against them!!! F these bastards","April 30, 2022"
494,Don’t wast your time or money!!,1 star,"Worst pull out of any brands I have tried! Don’t wast your money!! Yeah your 1g pod will last forever but you will be struggling to get high! Magnets are not even close to being strong enough let’s way to much airflow during a pull!! Ordered there upgraded battery of there official website and paid and extra 15 buck for shipping for (two day express delivery)!! Scam it took a week and a half to receive my order!! Worst part is I expressed my displeasure to stizzy and they just had a bunch of excuse (covid/getting order ready? Almost seemed like a auto response, Also took about 5 emails to get a response in 5 days!! So long story short shop company’s that care about you!! Stizzy is not one of them!!","March 20, 2021"
495,Not a kit,1 star,"Do not call it a ""starter kit"" when it is just a battery. A real starter kit has everything you need.","December 15, 2020"
496,Horrible magnets,1 star,Magnets don’t pull therefore don’t hit. Older models of this same product used to be better so they are just trying to save money. Very unprofessional,"March 29, 2021"
497,Way too weak,1 star,Still not strong enough to produce a decent size pull off the pod. The light starts flashing right when you get any vapor. And this is the BIIIG ADVANCED KIT. Lame.,"May 29, 2021"
498,"First timer, here.. 😂",1 star,Had no idea I had to buy the pod…I really wish it would ask (have an option) if you’d like to add pods.. I mean that would be Nice! So I’m on the site and don’t see that they only sell pods .. daaaame it lol … 🤦🏽‍♀️Stuck with a piece 😂,"September 19, 2021"
499,battery sucks,1 star,first of all starter kit NO you still need the pod! and wasn't charged when I got it charged it for 9 hours and still can't hit it. I don't know maybe it's defective.

506,Horrible vaporizer!,1 star,"It takes a few puffs to get a good hit. I prefer a different vaporizer I have. I just wanted a cheaper alternative. Well I guess I got what I paid for. A cheaper and not worth the money I spend, vaporizer. I had high Hope's for this vaporizer starting kit but sadly I wish I could give this product a negative 5 starts. Not worth your money!","May 07, 2018"
507,Died,1 star,"Have been using this with only one pod so far, charging it according to what it says and it broke before the first pod was half done.

513,Better Battery Better Buy,5.0 stars,"At first I thought this was just some hypebeast phallus sh!t make it bigger and pay more kinda thing, but actually this is worth the upgrade if you use it enough. For $20 more than the regular you get a battery that lasts significantly longer. I’ve heard “hits harder” attributed as well and I don’t know about that, it hits the same but you don’t have to charge as often. The design is really cool and less juul, more it’s own thing, plus I think it’s more durable and harder to lose. Dope pen, highly recommended - plug n’ play sounds like a d!ldo stiiizy all the way lol","April 04, 2020"

519,BIIIG STIIIZY for a first time vape pen indica,5.0 stars,Stuff hits super smoothly. Little to no inhaling is required to produce massive clouds. As a first time after a relatively long tolerance break it definitely got me to where I wanted to be 🙂🙃.,"May 19, 2020"
520,💯💯💯,5.0 stars,"As someone with high tolerance, the stiiizy reg. Kit wasn’t strong enough for me anymore. When I switched to this one I felt the difference when taking hits and I was zoooted..... and blinkers hit fire on this too💯 thanks!!!!🤯","November 25, 2020"
521,Stiiizy big battery kicks big butt !!!,5.0 stars,"Soooooo soooo impressed, it’s been since pre-legalization that I’ve messed with vape pens , the high was always to wispy and short lasting. But a friend of mine has been raving about this biiig battery and stiiizy in general so yesterday I took the plunge and got a purple biiig battery and a Pineapple Express cartridge, I bought many live resins and a half zip of wonderbrett and alien labs and some hash but never got to any of it , I opened the big battery and pod first just to get a tastes …. After three huge clouds I was so baked, I spent the rest of the day just hitting my new banger of a battery and was high every minute of yesterday. Definitely buy one !!! Can’t speak to the original battery but the big battery is a huge game changer!!!!","July 08, 2021"
522,"High Voltage, Big Clouds",5.0 stars,"This is my first Stiiizy product, and I am enjoying how good my Stiiizy pod & battery hit. The Biiig Stiiizy battery has high voltage which results in making bigger clouds. The high voltage also burns the wax a bit faster, but can definitely get you high in a couple hits. I recommend this Biiig Stiiizy battery.","January 21, 2021"
523,Great,5.0 stars,Stiiizy always comes out on top with the best products. This battery is great. Burns hotter and has a longer battery life. It is an advanced kit tho so if you mostly smoke the live resin pods I’d probably just stick with the regular battery as this burns really hot and longer.,"November 15, 2020"

So what’s the deal stiiizy I live right by a couple of your authorized sellers and they didnt even know about these batteries when I called!

534,Amazing product. Low Batt Light is top notch.,5.0 stars,"the big battery is really good. it lasts all day and before it just dies on you, the white light you see when you take a pull will turn red before the battery dies, it gives you time to smoke and not just be SOL. stiiizy is one of the best brands, quality and price are very very good.","July 19, 2021"

Never tried a pod, liked the sleekness, and Stiiizy rep was super nice. So instead of spending a comparable amount on a 510, bought a pod. I haven’t tried any other pod types. But this thing hits beautifully. Absolutely perfect. Airflow, amount of vapor draw, flavor, effect, etc. Absolute primo. So I quickly bought the Biiig. Then when they came out with the CDT line, I am in love again. Thank you for opening up shop in AZ :)","July 30, 2021"

Much luv, Keep it up!!!","May 28, 2023"
604,Hits way better then the original,5.0 stars,"This battery is an awesome upgrade. it's got good air flow and gives you nice big hits. The only thing I wish was different is that the pod (1g) would sit deeper in the battery and not protrude out so far. I would like even better if it actually covered the pod completely so that no light could get to the oil. Its bigger then the original battery so it's harder to conceal. It also has a nice sturdy heavy duty design. So in conclusion, other than my personal opinions, everything else about it is perfect and I would highly recommend it to anyone.","April 24, 2023"

707,Its koo',4.0 stars,kills the carts quicker but defiently worth it for the bigger hits. gets you higher faster.,"May 13, 2019"
708,Quality,4.0 stars,Great prices and quality safe Rec,"April 10, 2022"
709,No Complaints,4.0 stars,Battery almost never runs out,"March 24, 2022"
710,Nice stuffs,4.0 stars,"it's been long I taste raw shits, they got me today.","November 19, 2020"
711,Good design and strong hit,4.0 stars,"The advanced kit hits pretty good. The design is nice and sleek and easy to conceal., It's a nice vape as long as it doesn't die on me like most vapes have","July 25, 2019"
712,killin my carts lol,4.0 stars,this shit hitts heavy as f** I kill about half g a day it's amazing but they go out if you hit them to crazy but still bomb I'll keep buying them,"July 09, 2019"
713,9 out of 10 . i aint talking dwade.,4.0 stars,so far had this battery for 4 days now only needed to charge it the day i bought it. hasnt been producing less power its been consistent and i wonder when ill have to charge it again... wouldve gave 10/10 . But i just dont see how it hits better than the regular battery its like the same thing. only the starter kit would rip less once its about to die. i hope this one doesnt any time soon,"May 02, 2020"
714,Mechanical Decline,3.0 stars,"The new battery from stiizy is an anomaly. It's bases ahead of its previous revision with additional power and refined casing hull that's thicker and more hand comfortable. The first version had difficulties maintaining power thru the day with heavy usage. This battery now can withstand some abuse and still require more of your time. Problematic however is that it feels cheap. For the price point of $35, it shouldn't feel inconsistent on developmental quality which the first metal battery didn't encompass. It gets worst as the lazy engineering can't seem to get a pod to fit properly without movement when combined. The feeling of a misplaced pod may be a constant reality if your not careful. What this battery should be has passed. Maybe the next revision will implement these changes.Between both stiizy battery's this is the better choice by a slim margin.","August 09, 2019"
715,Ripped hard at first....,3.0 stars,"I was really impressed with this battery when I first got it, it was producing some really thick milky hits that were getting me super baked. After about 2 weeks, the voltage has already depleted and it’s not hitting any better than the original battery. In fact, it might be hitting a little worse, I’m taking some long draws off this thing and it’s producing some pretty weak clouds and my high is not as good as it was before. I love stiiizy but this was a disappointment. Might just stick with the old battery","June 22, 2019"
716,BUTTONS PLEASE,3.0 stars,serious guys why don't you have BATTERIES WITH A DAMN BUTTON.Sorry but pens that only hit when you draw just dont get that customized big hit.This is the one of the only reasons I don't buy STIIZY that much and when I do I get the SYRINGES so I can use a battery with a BUTTON. Hey but at least you guys sell your concentrates in SYRINGES cause I think every cartridge company should do that .,"April 16, 2019"
717,Big stiiizy batt,3.0 stars,Don’t get me wrong the battery smacks for sure but I’ve had a couple of times where It heated up my cart way too hot not to the point where I burn the wax but it was pretty warm but this one time I bought there live resin cartridge and almost halfway through the cartridge it burnt my wax they completely ruin the live resin cartridges.,"April 16, 2021"
718,Don't like the feel,3.0 stars,Battery doesn't feel like it's significantly longer lasting than the original but hits like a champ. Sometimes changing the flavors profile of the hit you are taking. That could be both bad and good.. If you're new to the stiizy battery I recommend you buy an extra battery in the future,"December 16, 2020"
719,Just vaping,3.0 stars,Yesterday 03/30/19 I went in to LA Kush collective in East La for a stiiizy patient appreciation day and it was buy one gram get a battery for a $1.00 so I bought 2grams and was able to get the new Biiig Stiiizy battery but unfortunately my battery is not working correctly.Went back to LA Kush and fortunately I was able to speak to the girl who was doing the Stiiizy promotion but unfortunately she couldn’t swap it cuz she was out of battery she was a blonde girl but I forgot but she told me to write a review and see what you guys are able to do for me because the dispensary also didn’t have the battery hope to hear from you guys soon PS your stiiizy Pods are still FIRE,"March 31, 2019"
720,BIIIG,3.0 stars,Higher temp kills your pod more quickly,"June 18, 2020"
721,Kills carts super quick,2.0 stars,Uses and excessive amount of wax for no reason if u want something to get u super smacked then get a plug and play but otherwise the normal battery is fucking incredible,"June 10, 2019"
722,Burns,2.0 stars,Idk if it just coincidence or not but right when I got the big battery my pods started tasting burnt,"September 10, 2020"
723,didn't even last 2 weeks.,2.0 stars,everything was going great. my first time trying stiiizy products. after 10 days it no longer works. won't even charge. doesn't light up at all. very disappointed.,"March 15, 2022"
724,Disappointed Big Stiizy,2.0 stars,"I ordered & paid for the Big Stiizy, but received the small one. My husband was upset with me, cuz he told me to buy the big one! But he had already used it so I couldn’t return it. 😟","November 05, 2022"
725,"Hesitant giving this poor grade, but...",2.0 stars,"The BIIIG boy hits great, it hits hard, it hits you in your brain and in your toes, but it also doesn't hit 80% of the time. I have found that having to hit the smaller battery more frequently with smaller intakes. With the BIIIG, we have to grab any inserted pod with our teeth, and apply downward pressure to ensure it actually recognizes the pod in it. Lots of pressure. I have bought 2 for my wife and myself, and it happened with both. The pods used in these situations work amazingly on the STIIIZY regular batteries. I love the pods, but I am disappointed with this particular battery that doesn't seem to want to accept a pod, flashing it's lights at you all the way. If there is anything I want to stress, it's that the pods of either size and regular batteries work wonders, with many options of each. So go look at their reviews, and pass this product.","October 05, 2021"
726,I got electrocuted!!,1 star,Charged the vape for the first time. When I tried to unplug the vape? The cord stayed inside and the entire outer casing came off! Electrocuted myself putting it back on. Unit should not fall apart in under 12 hours. Would love to get in contact with stiiizy over taking this to a higher authority. Been a user of stiiizy for over a year and I love the rest of the products.,"July 11, 2019"
727,Still not as good as plug and play,1 star,Stizzy flavors are good but don’t smack like a plugplay . FYI good luck smoking half grams with this one . I would smoke mine in like two days a day because it cart hot,"December 07, 2019"
728,Horrible Batteries,1 star,I have purchased both the small battery and the BIIG battery and both have yet make it threw one tip before it stops working. I love the way it hits. I like the new style. BUT MAKE A BATTER BATTERY. I dont want to put out $35 every month for a battery to be able to smoke a .5gram! its crazy,"September 21, 2021"
729,wow,1 star,great way for me to smoke through my cart faster. I finished a half gram in a day with this battery. what a waste,"November 16, 2019"
730,Garbage,1 star,I bought the big battery today and the cartridge. Charged to white. Doesn’t work,"September 28, 2019"
731,Don’t buy this online,1 star,I ordered a big battery and when I got there they gave me the original one and I went back to see if I could get the one I ordered which was the big one and they said no it was a bug from weedmaps so now I just have the normal battery smh,"June 01, 2023"

735,Honestly Trash,1 star,Man I love stiiizy I bought this battery and had it for 26 hours. I had it in my lap didnt see it got out of my car and it fell 2 feet to the ground and it just shattered in to 2 pieces and no longer works for 35 bucks its poorly made.,"January 04, 2021"
736,Burns flavor in the pod,1 star,It’s a good battery but you can’t consistently hit it without burning the cartridge. Compared to the small battery the big battery doesn’t really work like you think it would. honestly the small battery allowed me to hit my cartridge consistently without burning the cart.,"September 05, 2022"
737,Trash,1 star,what do you expect from a bad company haha,"July 27, 2021"
