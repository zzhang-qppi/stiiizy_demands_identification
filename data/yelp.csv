0,1-Aug-23,Great experience with Cody behind the counter. Knowledgeable quick and efficient. Would come back for sure!
1,12-Jun-23,"The security here is wild. Be prepared to be scrutinized and strip off all your bags, and anything that you wouldn't let an obvious criminal have. I'm surprised I didn't have to take my shoelaces out.Back in the day the mission used to be the place to go to find a dispensary. Now if you can go anywhere else, avoid the Mission if you can, and that counts for this place."
2,17-Nov-22,"I'm honestly super bummed - I loved coming here! like I've literally come here since it's been open, spent probably thousands of dollars, and my experience today made me not want to come back. This was the first time I ever received a faulty cart from stiiizy. I bought a stiiizy pod and had it for maybe a day, hit it TWICE, and was left with resin burning my lips  and spewing out of the top of the cart (actually something I researched saying that it means it's a faulty cart). I obviously didn't want to hit it anymore and they always say if something is wrong you have 7 days to come back and they will replace it. I waited 2 days & bring the pod back into stiiizy for someone to check it out and Jeff the manager said because it wasn't 1/2 way full there's no way to replace it. I didn't understand that bc I tried to explain to him that the pod was literally leaking into the into my stiiizy battery (pictures attached) and there was no way I could have hit it because it was leaking from both end, and how would the pod have still had more than 1/2 it's content when it was leaking... They didn't replace nor discount my next pod. Anyone experience this?"
3,3-Apr-23,I met Julian on Monday at l y t t in Pacifica. He did a father's job representing this company he has wonderful people's clothes I recommend everyone to go there I was truly delighted. With his outstanding yes please his people style.
4,23-Jan-23,"ILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!Terrible customer service. I went to pick up indica flower, the cashier gave me 3 options of indica and I picked the one with the highest THC which was 31%. I trusted that they gave me indica because that's what I asked for and thats what was repeated back to me. After I got the weed, I went to run an errand & once I got home to roll up. I seen that on the package it said ""HYBRID"". I don't smoke hybrid. Indica only. I didn't open the package, they also sent the receipt to my email so I didn't check it until I was getting ready to take the package back. I go back to the store to basically switch to a different one, not return but just switch it out. The person at the front desk told me they don't accept returns. The manager also came to me and told me that he doesn't do returns. I'm not understanding why you can't let me switch it out when I'm a loyal customer and come here often. The package was no where near open. What type of shit is that? Definitely won't be coming here ever again."
5,5-Apr-23,"Only thing I hate is I always get there right when the doors are closing at 945, but everyone working there is always extremely helpful"
6,27-Jun-20,"This place = great experience!!Wow! I walked out of here with a steal! They hit me so many times with great deals. The day I went, flower was 20% off, and first time customers receive 10% offOliver helped me make the best purchase. Ended up with biscotti and bday cake pods, cookies PR, and the bIIItes (which aren't in NV yet and they need to be!!!!) we fell in love with the stiiizy biiites!So anyways I got all of that for around $86 after tax. My jaw dropped too. Stiiizy on Mission has my business every time I come back to SF now. Place is super clean and also only one person allowed at a time due to covid restrictions."
7,28-Feb-23,I bought my stizzy probably a year or two ago and I loved going from cartridges to pods. But In the last month or two EVERY single pod I've bought leaks into my battery. It doesn't matter where I get it from either. Really upsetting that the quality has gone completely downhill
8,21-Oct-20,"BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. DON'T GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE YELLED AT. THIS PLACE WILL KILL YOUR VIBE. I totally understand that businesses have different protocols for COVID, but this place makes you feel uncomfortable. The first time I came here a short-haired tatted budtender helped me and she was rude af. You would think workers at a dispensary would be chill, NOT HERE.  Every other dispensary I have ever been to have had nice workers. So here was my experience today...I arrived with my sister (my sister who I live with), and we got our temperature taken. Cool. Next we checked in and the lady at the front said we had to stay six feet apart but get helped by the same budtender. Like I said, businesses can have whatever COVID protocols, but theirs is a little offputting. I was helped by a man that was cool, then my sister decided she didn't want to get anything. She walked up to me and a different worker said we couldn't be next to each other. My sister kindly said ""okay, I just wanted to accompany my sister"", and he rudely said ""WELL THEN YOU GOTTA GO OUTSIDE"". There must be poor management because these workers are WHACK. Save your time and money and go to any other dispensary. It's also cash only... why? It's 2020 and it's more common for dispensaries to take card now. Honestly, I wouldn't mind paying cash if the workers weren't so cold here.The dispensary around the corner looks way more welcoming. I actually tried going there but they were closing and recommended going to this trash place because they opened later. They should just tell people to come back when they're open because STIIIZY is horrible."
9,20-Feb-23,Lotta hella fine selections here at Stiiizy! This place is off the hook! Couldn't even find some of their dank in other dispensaries! I'mma be coming here more in the future to check out what latest dank they got!
10,8-Dec-22,"Went in for some things and waiting in line for 15 minutes or so , and bro with the fucked up flat top decided to wait till I was ready to pay to say he can't cash anyone out after 10pm, if this is the manager of the store I feel for them, big fuck you to you"
11,2-Nov-22,Defective pods and terrible customer service. The very first vape pod I purchased with them was defective. I had to return today but did not have my original packaging so they denied any exchange or refund. Apparently this happens a lot. So many other places you can go. Skip this one.
12,3-Jun-21,"Damn you guys are so rude. They rushed me to buy my shit (the guy with a full face covering and head thing on?) He was a rude little guy. Anyway I bought the weed I seen printed online for 16% on Riverview farms website.. when I stepped out that dispensary that shit said 8%. (Mind you I didn't check the percentage because I was sure it would be 16%) as it stated online.. I went back inside to ask for a switch of another strain because I didn't even open it yet smh.. he told me ""I cant exchange flower blah blah blah.. the new girl doesn't know what she's talking about in the front so yeah."" What? Bruh. $40 wasted. Was also trying not to make a scene because I have $33 to my name I'm stressed enough.Please stop hiring rude men who can't even greet you when you walk up to the counter.. I cant even get high on a mf Friday night. I think ima stick to buying weed somewhere else. Bleh"
13,4-Jun-20,"2 things here.1 Customer Service: This place has one really bad apple.  I love the staff here and they are very warm and welcoming but this one woman which is probably hispanic and is a little heavier ( I do not like to make labels, I just don't know her name and would like to describe her) She is completely RUDE.  From checking in clients to helping them pick flavors she is really rude with a super attitude.I honestly get uncomfortable every-time she helps me because she is NOT helpful and stays having a dirty look on her face.  You can tell she doesn't want to be there and literally give no effort.  I will literally let someone cut me inline so she's not the one taking care of me, because I know she wont. When I asked for something on the lower end she gave me this look that just rubbed me the wrong way and It has just stuck with me since. If I'm feeling like this I am sure others are as well.  And I feel bad for the rest of the amazing staff that has to share tips with her because she for sure isn't putting in work like the rest of them.2 Flower quality: For the most part the flower is good.  But I got a bag a while ago that was the absolute worst thing ive ever got from a club. They should not be selling anything like this, taste, smell, gross.  the weed tasted like it was either cut to early or had some kind of chemical burn. Just Nasty, and then they call it ""Blue Cookies"" or somthing thinking you're going to get that.  mmmmmmmmm Nope!  No club should be able to sell this garbage. waste to money. Picture below and beware."
14,8-Jun-21,Piece of shit scammers they sell half grams and say they are full grams this is a scam and company they deserve a zero everybody must know about this they sell half grams and charge you for a full gram they are completely scamming their customers this is complete bullshit
15,21-Dec-20,"Normally, I would've been surprised to find out Stiiizy has such a low rating. But after finding out they are a franchised business it makes sense to see the rating be so low. 1! First and foremost this, location did away with the one thing that made them super legit and always had me walking through the door. My military discount. Wow! Not just that but all discounts.2nd. The rude and horrible customer service that I received from the girl that must've thought that she was too cute to read off some hand written tags. It's not my fault her leg was hurting and she's working an unorganized sales floor that has the Stiiizy pod products in 2 different sections instead of having, ""two sections."" I'm spending over $200, forgive me for wanting to know my options! Get a better set-up!I really wish dispensaries would stop hiring these ""so-called"" cute girls thinking they'll sell more and in actuality they end up having horrible customer service because they actually have to work. And it's not just standing there looking cute getting tips. And then they get hit on so much, they end up thinking every guy is going to hit on them and their customer service lacks.But then the very few real people and ""guys"" who are actually knowledgeable and willing to work, end up having a hard time getting those jobs, that they would actually benefit the business... Due to hiring half-assed wannabes."
16,10-Nov-21,"Had gone to this location a couple of times specifically for disposable vape pens. The customer service on my first experience was sub- par, they assume that you know how their system works and how the store is organized, nobody seems enthusiastic to help. Yesterday I went to return a faulty disposable battery and with about half of the pod left in they claimed it stopped working because I was out of wax. There was clearly plenty of oil left in the cartridge and it seemed to be a problem with the battery. They told me tough luck and sent me on my way. Definitely the last time I will support that store and NEVER buy any stiizy products anywhere else. This company needs to be ran more professional and train their staff on customer service and product knowledge. Very disappointed"
17,18-Nov-20,"******WARNING!!!!!!****IF YOU WISH TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS!!!!If I could I'd give a negative star. Their service doesn't even equate to zero because the way the treat you will have you feeling attacked and violated.They disrespectfully kicked me out for wanting to have a conversation with my own biological sister whom I was with in the store."
18,10-Jan-21,"If you close at 9:50 update your hours online (weedmaps, leafly, etc).Even the Yelp page has 10:00 but under it there's a note that says 9:50. Which is it? Get your house in order. Update your hours or, you know, stay open til you say you will.And if you're not gonna bother, at the very least at least pretend to care that a patient rushed to your establishment instead of shooing them away like pests when they arrive. Is this one of those places where people go to get disrespected? Maybe that flies in LA, but it doesn't in most places. And by looking at other reviews it looks like they have a culture problem they are either unwilling or unable to address."
19,17-Mar-22,Was at the Stiiizy Mission St. location last night and bought a honey leaf OG Kush cartridge that was defective but did not know it until I discarded the receipt and packaging in a dumpster. The SORRY ASS MANAGER would exchange my cartridge without the package that it came in. Their weed is for shit and they sell defective Vape cartridges. Once in a while they'll have a strain of weed that's good but other than that if you want quality stay away from this location.
20,6-Sep-20,"I just went into this dispensary for the first time. My boyfriend usually buys me gummies for me to help sleep at night. ANYWAYS, I figured I'd go with him to check it out, considering I've never been here. Yes, this place was compliant with all the COVID protocol's, which I can appreciate bc my daughter is high risk. We are standing in line on the same sticker six feet from the other people in line. Out of no where this guy yells across the counter, hella loud at me to stay 6ft apart from by bf. ??? Ok. I get it. So my bf moves up first, I stay where I'm at. It becomes my bfs turn to go up to the counter, so I follow him..  because 1. I've never been here, idk how this works 2. We are together 3. Ultimately we are paying together. 4. My bf was going to point out the gummies I've tried vs ones I liked etc.... Then I get semi yelled at again and was told to ""get back!!""..... ???? Wtf?  I said, ""it's ok then, I'll just wait outside.. what's the point?"" I wanted to take a look at stuff with my bf just bc he's the one that knows what I'm looking for. But anyway, I figured he can grab it like he normally does. So I go stand outside, some creepy ass dudes driving by honking and whistling at me. I go peak inside to see if my bf is wrapping up and paying.. and I see there's a guy who WE DID NOT COME WITH all up on my bfs back,  looking at the same shit my bf is (not even 6 inches apart) but yet I couldn't stand next to him to take look? Makes no sense. Also, I'd like to add, they didn't even grab the right wax he wanted, but he was too nice to go in and complain. Yes, I'm sure whoever was working could've helped me, but being called out by this person 2 times in a line of 5-6 people (all guys, mind you) definitely didn't make me feel comfortable wanting any customer service from them. Maybe they should spread their product out more... And have the line completely outside.. in case people want to go in with someone. I can't be the ONLY person, that wanted to stand next to their significant other while picking out their product(s) ((WHOM THEY LIVE WITH. ))Also, If you're going to call out a customer (in front of people) maybe you should have a staff member walk up to them and explain the situation (so what.. each of us would take a turn to pick shit out, and my bf would come back and pay?). Or have security explain how it's being done with COVID. Security, and the front desk lady knew it was my first time, but yet no one explained how anything worked. Just overall unprofessional."
21,22-Jan-22,I've been coming here for a while now. I always have a good experience with these guys. Some bud tenders might be more chill than others but overall everyone is really nice. Regardless of other peoples own negative experiences I'd still recommend these guys. Prices are legit and they have almost everything you want.
22,2-Nov-20,"This club is a joke, they gave all these discounts just to get people to come in so they didn't close during covid, just to take them away DURING COVID . Also it's not like it's poppin the lines are long because the bud tenders are slow and and it seems like there are 10 people working behind the booth when really their talking about nothing and 1 or 2 people are working , I will not  be coming back , everyone to Urbana around the corner, they take card and delivery. This club can go back to Southern California to be honest"
23,8-Dec-20,I give this place another shot because my little sister wanted to try plus she just turned 22 so it's all good. Thank you so much Jason for all your help. You helped me my 1st time there and I so happy you helped my lil sis this time. You're so awesome. Love the way you were very patient with her and all the information you gave her. Thank you so very much.
24,13-Oct-20,"Bummer. Service here has gone downhill since they changed from LaCorona. Stopped carrying the Lowell farms I liked or the dog walkers in the tiny tins. Front desk attendant had to shout instructions at me over their loud music. Maybe turn it down? Now cash only. They make you use this silly atm up front. Husband and I went in for a couple things and even though we arrived together, weren't allowed to stand near each other the required 6 feet from the counter and look at the menu. Budtenders kept shouting at us to separate. I used to stop by here often, but I won't be back."
25,11-Aug-20,"Had a pretty terrible experience at this dispensary. I went in looking for a pax pod (yeah my bad), and when I was buying it I asked the person helping me twice if the pod would work with pax. He said yes twice. I walked out the door and realized that the label didn't say pax at all. When I went back in, I told them my situation and they had me stand back in line and the manager told me that they couldn't return it or refund it at all. She said that the package looked opened, even though I had just left the store. It was extremely frustrating because I don't own a stiizy battery, and they were unwilling to do anything about it even though their employee had confirmed with me that the pod was compatible with pax when they aren't. I will not be coming back here. Highly recommend purple star instead - better prices and better service."
26,16-Feb-21,I've been a customer for many months.I've always been treated with respect by the staff and managers. Luis helped me out today and he was great.
27,21-Feb-21,"I love Stiiizy products, but this store location doesn't have the best customer service. And they never have any deals going on like every other dispensary I've been to. What's up with that? I do think those sealed baggies they put your items in are nice though. For whatever that's worth..."
28,19-Jul-21,"Looking at other reviews I guess I'm not the only one who's dealt with a rude sales girl who loves to give attitude and yell at customers. Came here with my dude and although we were buying separately we were standing next to each other and the crazy chick up front starts screaming at us to be six feet apart. Like ma'am, we literally live in the same household so how does it make sense for us to be six feet apart? Even if it is the store policy there's absolutely no reason to act all crazy about it. Anyway this place has hella bad vibes, don't recommend."
29,29-May-22,I love coming to this location! I just went about 2 days ago and the Budtender Gems was killin it recommending so many options when I was getting overwhelmed with all the flavors. They told me to try to the CDT Pods and I recommended White Truffle and it's now my new favorite flavor! Gotta come back some more!
30,11-Dec-20,Went in today wanting to buy some products. Wanted to support a local business. Needed to buy my months worth of supplies. It was so loud I could not hear the employee behind the counter; they proceeded to pull their mask away from their face and continued to talk at me. I told her I needed a minute; and they continued to talk AT me. Please let a person look and ask the questions. I was hounded so much I left and went to another shop.  The security guard and reception were very nice. The sales employee was too aggressive.
31,31-May-22,Really loved the experience. The receptionist had a great personality and made my first dispensary experience as smooth as possible. The guys working in the back knew exactly what I needed based off what I was looking for and the product definitely met those expectations. Really great place and will be returning for future re-ups.
32,21-May-22,"Catherine has to be the best and most bubbly receptionist I have ever met!!!! You guys need to make her a budtender, 10/10 I'll deffffff be coming back"
33,20-Sep-20,Everyone is friendly here. They have social distancing tapes on the ground and rules to follow. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. It's a clean establishment. It's cash only. They have a ton of selection. Parking is metered and not too terrible.
34,30-Mar-20,"This shop is awesome!! I go here a couple of times a week because they've got the best prices around. I purchase my Heavy Hitters cartridges and all my flower here, esp on Thur and Fri because they have flower deals on those days. I live close by near the Mission District and their location is only 7 mins away from my home. Everyone from the security to the front desk staff and budtenders are uber welcoming and professional."
35,25-May-21,"What a joke. It clearly says online that they're open until 10pm daily. I showed up at 9:44pm And they turned me away stating that they ""close in 5 minutes"", Pointing to a sign on the door that says ""10 AM to 9:50 PM daily"". I showed them the current time on my phone and the time listed online, apparently they don't like being proven wrong because the guy shut the door in my face. I'll definitely be going around the corner to Urbana from now on. I normally do since it's a way better business and has friendlier staff, but they close at 9 PM and I couldn't make it in time."
36,7-Apr-22,"Always a lit time with Alycia! If she's there definitely go to her, she treats me like family. Literally! 5/5 stars for this place. Definitely gonna come back here."
37,16-Apr-20,Good shit they have the best bud and prices in Bay Area. And the best part is that all the tax is included in the price you see
38,2-Feb-20,"I've been here a few times because it's convenient and chill, but today I had an experience that turned me into a forever loyal customer!I had an issue with a broken vape cartridge I purchased, and it turned out to be incompatible with my battery module. Even though they were super busy while I was there, Issy (the manager) did some in-depth research for me to determine the type of cartridge I should get in the future, and helped me find a battery that would work with the products I have currently. She truly went above and beyond to help me. This place rocks and I will definitely be making this my home store!!"
39,22-Aug-21,Always a go to spot in The Mission. The staff is very friendly and always directs me to what I am looking for. The Stiiizy staff is the best.
40,26-Jul-22,"As a ""tourist"" I visited this location and my ID was scanned in ( I'm from Out of state) Spent a good amount of money. Note my DL had a piece of tape on it from being cracked, not broken. I flew across the country and this same ID was accepted via TSA. Returned to make an additional purchase 2 days later and was turned away because of that same little piece of tape. Now mind you, my ID was ""scanned in"" at my first visit and my ID was valid when I spent money but then not today? It's cool tho... I will spend my money else where. Cannabis is legal where I'm from so you're Not doing me any favors, and Out of principle I will not be purchasing from your chain and  no one I know will be neither. Girl at the front counter ( little nerdy with glasses,but cute) is rude as shit and pulls the ""state compliance"" card and refuses to listen... rude and just talks over you like you've done something wrong. Bad for business attitude for sure."
41,13-Mar-22,The receptionist cat really made my day when I walked in she helped me get in and out by giving  me helpful tips like the daily deals for the day and the st pattys deal couldn't ask for better Customer service !
42,24-Sep-19,"It's impossible to list why I'm so upset. This used to be a great place. I was told some time ago that they were undergoing a remodel. This is on a whole different level, something else. It was a take over from a massive company. All the neighborhood charm, all the local flavor, and any deals that helps retain people and welcome people from the neighborhood back as if they were just family members...gone. So is my business.Robert, the security guard was the only familiar face to greet me when I returned after the 'remodel'. After I checked in, they scanned my ID again scanned my rec again and welcomed me in with a 10% first time visitor discount as if I'd never been there.I found that extraordinarily insulting. Especially since they asked if it was my first time back since the 'remodel'. After they found out I was a regular, they still treated me like it was my first time into not just that facility but any cannabis dispensary. They can keep my 10% I just want my old place back. I might just have to go back to buying illegally. At least those dealers know you. Wipe this place off your map because they are no longer La Corona. Not in name, not in staff, not in atmosphere, not in practice, not in neighborhood, not in anything. It doesn't even fit The Mission which was the whole mission of La Corona in the first place. I remember a local hardware store in my hometown sold out to a major company. All the old staff that had been there for 30 years and kept that place running left because of how management treated them afterward. They closed a year later because all the local business keeping it afloat stopped using it. I hope that happens to this new place."
43,14-Mar-21,"I wish the budtenders didn't make me feel like I was wasting their time and that they at least ACTED Like they were in the business of customer service instead of just tolerating my questions about products. I'll be avoiding this place after that experience just now. Especially, as a female, ya'lls MALE employees should treat female customers better."
44,31-Dec-20,"I love coming here, prices are just right, the people are awesome and well where else can a bunch of ladies start dancing to BBD's Poison on a Friday afternoon? :)"
45,1-Mar-22,"NO CAP I came in like the very last minute I could. I felt bad but Stiiizy is always on point. The staff is always friendly and I love the energy they radiate. Tonight Ernesto helped me get in and out and made sure my order was in before 10. After that they can no longer take orders or accept payment. Even though I came in with 5 left to spare, I didn't feel rushed and the service was great! Thank you Ernesto!"
46,27-Dec-21,Stiiizy think they slick . Smh San Francisco put the no tax on the price of weed because people didn't want to pay 60 plus for an 8th and went to the streets. So now Stiiizy already put the tax on the weed price . So the 8th still 60 plus . Y'all funny but it's capitalism at its finest.
47,5-Oct-20,You can't look at the weed before you buy it. The staff are uneducated on the product. The staff is aggressive. You would think people selling weed would be laid back and chill but it's like they are all angry. The Davis location is further and smaller but there is much better service and the staff can actually talk about the product AND they let you see your weed before you purchase it.
48,30-Nov-20,"Overpriced.  The place aesthetically is great but too bougie for my taste.  The weed is subpar, so you're paying for the expensive visual experience.  The cashiers have very little knowledge of the products and strands.  Great if you want to take a pic for Instagram, not if you want some good cannabis products."
49,30-Nov-20,I was visiting from Seattle I've never been to a cannabis club in California before. I was not aware of the brands of cannabis in California and this club but Sofiea helped me to get familiar with products at this club. I left with exactly what I wanted.
50,7-Dec-20,Cool prices but the staff is hella weak and don't care. Just had to walk out cause I was waiting to be checked out but they were taking more customers in to where no one could ring me up. Thanks for the effort won't be coming back here again
51,1-Dec-20,Very bad experience All the time when I asked for product the said out the store and the give me bad products I will never  go there
52,6-Jan-21,"These guys have the best love rosin badder and other dab/pods. Joe. S. Hooked me up, he had to dig for the one I wanted. Cherry pie live rosin badder"
53,31-Jul-20,"LOVE THIS STORE. Love the daily deals, love the vibes! Tee and Liz are the best and I can't wait to shop WAX WEDNESDAY!! Best in class service here every single time !!"
54,15-Jun-21,Pretty sure the I's in STIIIZY stand for impossibly inept imbeciles. If you're gonna shut the door on medical patients' face because it's 9:49pm then don't have your hours as 10pm. Came here from pretty far away because their prices were better and it was the only time we could but every time they're just rude as hell. The budtenders obviously know a lot but god forbid you ask them any questions. Not to mention one of them took my friends information from her account to incessantly text her then got all pissed off when she said she wasn't interested. Dawg you really out here being the worst to customers and then make them too uncomfortable to come back but whatever y'all make your coin harassing people. If you made it to the end of this review then you might as well drive down the block to Greenthumbs.
55,14-Mar-22,"Reason is that they do not support black people , even the ones that work for them . The Bay Area supports black people but stiizy employs blacks just so they won't get backlash but they treat their black employees and Latin employees like trash . Yes they will find few blacks to say they been treated well but I know for sure they don't , from San Francisco area to concord area all the way down to alameda county . I can tell you about their employees getting treated unfair and customers and contracted employees also . That's why they don't be getting sales like that also cause of how they treat their own staff and customers . How you in the business but don't know customers or what's actually legal for them to do . Anybody need factual information on how they are treating employees or customers , we will be having reviews and discussion on a platform coming soon , and we actually didn't want to do it like this but something has to change big weed companies don't care about their customers or employees. I wonder how the board will feel about this information of this club operating the way they do . Culture vultures , I should actually start posting the videos of customers and they way we treated as customers"
56,12-Dec-20,Solid spot to scoop all the delicious flowers and concentrates. Clean location with all the proper protocol. Appreciate the hospitality and recommendation from Dennis.
57,8-Mar-20,"Charged different prices for same product last 3 times , on same day ,with same daily deal bad customer service 4 out of the 5 times I've been.The product is great ,the attitude and the getting lied to about pricing is enough to buy from another source."
58,30-Apr-20,"I love this cannabis shop. I come here a few times before I have to go back home. Everyone's nice and loves to explain to me in detail, on what I'm buying :) friendly peeps. Would def recommend to my friends who go to cannabis shops!"
59,18-Nov-19,"WOW!!! Front desk guy was MAD Rude to me!!! I came in all chipper and polite, dispute the fact I may Be another industry person he sees 20th time that same day, But his customer service skills lack! He mocked me for coming in, straight up fake typed and was like ""I will get on it and let someone know. Your only the 100th vendor that came in!"" He didn't even give me a chance to even set myself apart. He just tore me apart. Then chewed up a menu he asked me to leave. If this is what the brand is about.... being haters and judging people at the front door, I want no part of it. Any Customers who seek compassion or friendly service, It's not at that shop. If your a little hype beast, and love to troll around. Then this is your shop!"
60,6-Mar-21,First time customer of Stiizy. They sold me expired Kanha Cannabis Infused Gummies. The tenders was brusk and had limited knowledge of the products they were selling. I will be contacting the Office of Cannabis to submit a formal complaint.
61,7-Oct-19,"This place kinda blows now that they remodeled and changed to stiizy. The people are still friendly and the door guy is the same thankfully (he's dope) but this place is coming off hella corporate now. But the product was more expensive for the same stuff and they CHARGE 3 DOLLARS to use your damn card now! The ONLY good change I noticed was that if you're a sf resident you get a 5-10% discount or something like that. Other than that, this place isn't worth it anymore."
62,8-Jul-21,"This rating is for Jasmine! I called in to ask about apparel and she was polite, fast and efficient. Thank you for your help!"
63,16-Apr-21,"check the date! check the date! check the date! this place is known for having great deals for moldy, old and expired products. even the $80 flower is way beyond old!! ask for the date before you buy anything because they will not do a return or refund. i know"
64,2-Oct-19,I dropped by for the Grand Opening. The staff was friendly enough however everything is behind glass with no prices listed. The items I asked about were not in stock even though they were on display. The clerk helping me did not know the products. On top of everything else they had a tip jar out! That is like going to Walgreens and having to tip your clerk.  If they can't pay the staff enough nor educate them I don't want to shop here.
65,18-May-21,"be careful what you buy here!!! i made the wrong decision to make a store pickup order through weedmaps. there menu says live but that may be a lie! i purchased a 8th here for what there ""live"" menu said was quite fresh and high on thc. what i received was completely the opposite. the 8th was very low on thc, it was close to expiring and the 8th looked extremely wrinkled and crushed the manager said the false misleading advertisement of the product was not there fault but weedmaps. however upon speaking to customer service it was clearly stiiizys fault on misleading consumers on purchasing false  authenticity and quality of a product then refusing to take ownership when there receipt even says otherwise. if thats not close to stealing i don't know what is. the manager could of easily deemed it defective but at every turn chose not to take responsibility. Out of all my years and all the clubs I have ever been to this was the first time a dispensary FAILED to take responsibility for there wrong doing. pretty shady moves by such an establishment.---- DONT COME HERE, they sell EXPIRED weed then won't refund you AT ALL even though the moldy weed is potentially hazardous for anyone with stomach issues. --- GO TO *PURPLE STAR*----- or ----Mission Organic---"
66,16-Oct-19,"STIIIZY replaced la corona wellness in the south mission. It has really renovated the space making it visually appealing. Clean lines, bright lights, attention to detail make this store feel like a great modern shopping experience. Everyone I have interacted with is so friendly and helpful. Yea, it skews to STIIIZY branded products but they also have a lot of other products that will keep you satisfied. Also gotta say I got the STIIIZY pod system and like it much better than pax. The toke are smoother, taste is better and the cartridges seem to last longer. Overall would recommend."
67,27-Dec-19,Awesome place and staff. Just moved up to this area from San Jose and am so glad to stumble down here. Girl at the front desk was super friendly and great. The guy helping me helped me find good choices that I don't regret. Definitely coming back here.
68,2-Jan-21,Chris had the worst customer service. Very rude and not helpful. Made me not want to come back here. First time here and was a bad experience.
69,23-Feb-20,"This place is awesome!!! They have super nice employees that help you out with any questions you have. Also, I've saved so much money because they always have deals! The gummies they have are my absolute favorite"
70,22-May-20,"Lost my battery and happened to be in the Mission, walked in and was assisted by Francis-- sold on live  resin Ice Cream Cake, Bloom Disposable pen Maui Waui . excellent service. Thank You!"
71,11-Dec-20,I was walking home from work the other day and I noticed a big poster inside this place where a African-American man is smoking a marijuana joint. This is another example of black exploitation. Whoever owns this place should be ashamed.This place should definitely be boycotted by civil rights advocates.
72,14-Feb-21,"What's up with buying a $40 joint SMALLER THAN MY PINKY and when you light it up the thing it's just ashes no smoke. Went back into the store since I am not a new costumer nor smoker, just for them to escort me out on v-day... when this happens the manager should've checked it and offer a replace instead of arguing with the costumer saying it was halfway...what part of all ashes no smoke did he not understand..oh and on my way out there was someone else complaining that his stuff wasn't good either DEFINITELY NOT RETURNING"
73,1-Nov-19,One of my favorite new clubs in San Fran. I can't in there first time a few days ago and had to come back because the quality was amazing and the staff was very friendly! Come in for great quality and friendly service!
74,4-Jan-20,Solid prices. Solid first-timer discount. Solid knowledge and service. Left with great recommendations and stuff that is every bit as great as advertised. Welcome to the hood!
75,8-Sep-21,"Awful company. Particularly awful store. Went in for the first time, asked for a vape cartridge. Budtender offers bla bla bla. It's weed so I don't really care. I say sure. Product is not viewable because of their packaging. I walk out of store, open packaging. Vape cartridge does not fit on my battery. I have that circular/cylindrical battery that is by far the most common. Like the one everyone has. I didn't even know there was another type. Apparently there is. Budtender knew they offer 2 types but didn't have a thought to maybe clarify which of the 2 types I needed. He just presumed to know. I turn back into the store. Bare in mind that I had left the store 30 seconds prior. Manager is argumentative in that passive aggressive sorta way where they're making it like I'm the one being difficult. It's beyond absurd. They tell me absolutely no returns/exchanges. The product is mine now but they'll happily sell me a second cartridge. They tell me to phone customer service. The number they provide does not lead you to anyone. They rip me off for $35 because of their own mistake. Could have had a customer for years.  Whatever."
76,20-Dec-19,S/O to Izzy @ Stiiizy. I really appreciate how patient she was with my indecisiveness!!
77,29-Jan-21,"Today I walked in and was very displeased with the way my orders were taken care of. Female worker was too high on the job and just wasn't on the same planet I was. I let her know about the mistake she made and that I wanted a full gram carts, ended up getting half grams and it seemed like all she could do is laugh about the fact that she made a mistake. I came back in trying to fix my issue which was to get my order right, but solely based off the employees mistakes no matter what, I was told by managers ""Sales are final"". Even if the employees lack of attentiveness was the reason why my order was MESSED UP!! They say thats POLICY..."
78,20-Aug-20,Staff are not there to make your experience better they only want to sell you weed i would recommend barbery coast in sf there is two locations both are excellent
79,18-Dec-20,"Sophia was amazing!!!! great customer service, friendly store, top notch weed, highly recommend"
80,1-Dec-19,I Love this Dispensary! I've been coming here for a few years now (before the Grand Opening) & I'm very pleased with the new set-up. The staff is hella friendly & very knowledgeable. They have fire flowers & lots of other great products. I really appreciate the the staff's patience especially when its so hard to choose from everything they have. I would recommend anyone here. Especially if you suffer from any medical conditions. There is so many CBD products to choose from.
81,8-Dec-20,"the staff was super welcoming, we took forever but the home girl Sabrina really took care of us and took the time to actually look through their stock to make sure we left with some that zaaa"
82,24-Sep-20,"First of i never been here right but was told they get pretty packed  but I literally jus called and a man named Gabriel picked up and i said "" hello how are you just wanted to asm if you guy's were busy at the moment and he was speaking with another customer at the moment then i said ""hello?"" and he said your good togo to the other customer but gave me hella attitude and said ""i said yes we're busy"" but with a stank ass attitude.  Never been in AND NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT TOGO IN THANKS GABRIEL YOU RUDE AHH"
83,16-Feb-21,One of my favorite dispensaries in the city. Good music and very friendly staff. Especially Joseph! Always provides 5 star service and has great recommendations for tree. Will return!
84,15-Aug-21,"bud tenders just want to upsell you to make commission. not thorough about products , i felt very rushed from the counter . dont go to this stiizy location , they will kill your vibe, rob your pockets and laugh about it !!"
85,29-Jan-21,"First time I went I was so disappointed by the dry weed I bought. The second time i mentioned this and one of the staff grabbed two bags and said ""this is what dry weed sounds and feels like, this is what fresh weed feels like. I won't do that to you."" And I got some fire weed and I thank you! The 3rd time today I asked dude with the fluffy hair if he had anything good and not to high priced and BAM. 36$ eight or some stupid fire CRUs Pure Kush. My man! This is my club now!"
86,14-Jul-20,"I went in for the first time last night excited to see what they were about. I had already knew what I wanted to purchase after looking on Weedmaps, to make things easier. Although it stated they updated their inventory within 3 minutes of looking, when I had got to the counter the budtender (who had a good attitude) sadly had NO KNOWLEDGE of the merchandise. She stated that the item I wanted was sold out after not knowing where to look. When I asked her to show me a similar option it was like asking as car salesman to show me a house! They had a special promotion for new members. When I asked about that deal for the day she continued to not be ANY assistance. Beyond annoyed that Urbana (my go to was already closed) I went down the way to Dr Greenthumb who is always hassle free. I'm sad writing this review! As much as I thought I'd love the place when I walked in, I left quicker than I waited in line. Either train your staff with product classes or get new people in there all together!!!!!!"
87,3-Jan-21,"Dennis gave great customer service, and he is very friendly and social as well gave me great recommendation."
88,18-Jan-21,"Great Weed Club , Richie helped me out ! He's very knowledgeable and great conversation"
89,4-Sep-20,"I've been here maybe a handful of times mostly for daily deals and the close proximity to my house, as I usually go to Purple Star and used to frequent Dr Greenthumb when it was cookies. Anyways I decided to jump on stiiizy board and treated myself to 2 half g pods and a rose battery for $60 (each was $20..normally $25). Figured can't beat that price as $25/20 per half gram pod! I have enjoyed them but I have recently got a Dart battery (480mAh) which blows the stiiizy(210mAh) out of the water...I think its got closer mAh to the biiig stiiizy battery? Anyways as for the actual location its great as theres usually decent street parking and you can usually get away with parking in safeway lot for a bit. The security and receptionists have always been friendly and have zero complaints about! The budtenders have been pretty good but the last time I was there I was overcharged. Hopefully I can get the rest of my change back even though it's been a little while since, but I bought 1 half gram pod on a Sunday when they are supposed to be 20% off and for some reason I ended up only getting 5% off?? I had a new trainee BT who was being trained by another BT so there were 2 of them but the newbie rung me up and idk how the BT okayed the price and everything. I'm extremely shy and have really bad social anxiety and if I feel the least bit intimidated I tend to have trouble speaking up for myself. Thus I should have but didn't feel comfortable trying to argue the correct price. I'm on an extremely tight budget due to being broke thanks to the useless EDD. I know that's my issue but just trying to explain as I'm not trying to be a complainer just a very meek and socially awkward patient The first time was perfect & BT took the time to explain (w/o asking!) all diff products and listened to what I was looking for so she was able to help me find the perfect flavored hybrid & indica pods! I got Rose battery instead of Rose Gold but that's ok still cute. Location is top notch as the actual store its self is super modern and looks almost too modern and nice.. seems like most newer dispo's are trying to use this clean hi tech modern look which is very professional looking. However there is only one or 2 of the product displays so I never really feel comfortable looking thru all the displays to see what I'd like..which sucks cos I saw a product I've been searching the entire bay area for but it wasn't listed on their menu so I guess I'll have to ask them whenever I go back next. Wish they carried more Dart battery pods because they hit the best out of ANY of the vape pen batteries on the market! Overall the budtenders are the only thing that might use a little more fine tuning however they arent that bad and there is usually SO many of them that it's really hard to give a proper review on them. Overall clean easily accessible location with pretty good selection but the pods are always in and out of stock. Most of the time they are usually out of the specific size and strain pod I want but can usually find a close alternative."
90,6-Apr-20,"I came in here and bought close to $400 worth of stuff on Friday 2/27. One of the pods was defective but by the time I noticed it I was back in San Jose(where i live). I cane back on Tuesday 3/3 with my defective pod, box, and receipt. As per their policy on weedmaps and their website, I thought I'd be getting a replacement pod but I come in and every bud tender is a straight up clown. Every budtender pretty much said that my pod was mainly gone so they couldn't do anything for me because the manager on shift isn't very helpful and would only honor me with 20% off on my next pod, heres the deal though, its a DEFECTIVE LEAKY pod. Do they know what the definition of a leak is? Its when things accidentally lose and/or emit their contents which in this case is a $60 gram of concentrate. This pod was already missing 25% of its contents when I first got it, it maybe leaked away another 50% of it, I showed them nonstop that their is still some left in their but it just looks messy because I had the pod in my pocket on the hour car ride back to SF. Nobody wanted to hear me out, they obviously don't know their own product or are too lazy to help out a customer that spent almost $400 just a week ago. Special shoutout to Maria, she is terrible person and an even worse employee. Only person in this establishment that deserves any respect is Elizabeth who was the original budtender and manager who helped me out on Friday 2/27, too bad she was out that day when I came back because even a couple budtenders hinted that she probably would have given me a new pod. Anyways, this place sucks, budtenders probably think they're hot stuff cause they work at Stiizy but they're all lazy bums."
91,4-Dec-19,"I liked it more when it was la corona. It's alright, but cash only and they doNt  post the correct prices."
92,21-Nov-19,"Love Neka!!! She was so amazing and so sweet. Really got educated on everything. Such an amazing place with even better employees. Neka needs a raise, only coming back because of how awesome she was!"
93,16-Oct-19,"So I considered giving 2 stars but I decided to keep it REAL as we do in the Bay Area...I personally loved La Corona and referred everyone I knew or came in contact with to them. But STIIZY. The Grand Opening was semi exciting due to my bud tender Shauna's  positive attitude and knowledge of both the old and new product but after that things went completely down hill. The dispensery is way too bright...the deals are gone...and its way too loud in there, on top of the fact that at least 3 to 4 people scream out welcome to STIIZY & stay STIIZY every time you walk in. It's redundant and annoying ..Maybe LA residents appreciate that but the Bay DOES NOT. There aren't any prices on any of there products so you have to wait for someone to tell you which can be very time consuming...needless to say I haven't been bk since the Grand Opening"
94,16-Jul-20,"Good customer service and great quality products, not to bad of a wait in the line, and their efficient every time"
95,6-Dec-19,"i found Stiiizy on Weedmaps earlier this week when i was planning a busy day and was trying to find a place along my way to pick up some concentrates. I have made two trip here since and i gotta say they have some pretty awesome prices, and huge selection of just about everything. the staff has been very friendly both times ive been in. My only gripe is that the concentrates display is kinda difficult to view and with the heat from that lights in the display case the concentrates start to break down and dont look so attractive, i was looking for a particular consistency but everything in the display was altered and there is no knowing how long they have been sitting with lids off baking on low. also wasnt able to smell them. i decided on the ursa skittles which in the display had a sugar-y consistency but when i got home and open it it was much closer to a diamond sauce. -online menus need work, concentrates are in multiple categories and hard to filter though"
96,10-Nov-19,"Visiting the area to eat and I accidentally spot this place and I love stiiizy ‍ so I went in just to peek. Place was nice as hell and professional. Dude who took my id shared the same birthday as me which I thought was dope since it's it a birthday you hear to often. They had a new flavor that was blue gummy that I want to try! But they weren't all pushy like some dispensaries. I was on my way back to where I live, and just glanced at the shirts which were nice shirts, and the guy who took my id went and just shot me whichever one I wanted and I thought that was bad ass. I will be back to visit with lots more money, thanks guys for a good first experience."
97,6-Jan-20,Best place on Mission/30th. Great service and great solid prices. You get what you pay for for sure. Highly recommend being a member here you get a helluva a lot more deals than anywhere else
98,24-Oct-19,"This is one of the best dispensaries i have ever been too, the workers are really friendly and they have the best pods and also have some dam good weed, its decent pricing and not overpriced one bit, i strongly recommend every one in san francisco that smokes weed to try out Stiiizy"
99,18-Jan-20,The employees work hard to keep the line moving and seem to always offer great deals. Not to mention it's near by. I would definitely recommend!
100,24-Oct-19,Super friendly and have a great selection. The prices are really good and they will treat you with then best respect MUST COME!!!!
101,7-Aug-23,Awsomeeee costumer service! best dispensary I've ever been too  come here all the way from montebello don't matter how far
102,7-Aug-23,"i have been coming to this location for years now. i have never had a bad experience, the staff is always greeting with a smile and my favorite part is when everyone yells welcome. i've had multiple tenders and everytime i get asked about my day, what are my plans and so forth and it's always great when they're trying to make connections and conversation i have never been to a shop where everything is so nice and clean and the people actually seem like they enjoy their job and the time they spend there. i really hope the great experiences continue. melanie melendez"
103,21-Aug-23,Best place to get your pods quick. Always professional organize and generally nice. Haven't had a problem with my pod once pretty good weed
104,18-Aug-23,Great service & kind people. Not to mention always are knowledgable about product. Highly recommend this location for first timers.
105,25-Jul-23,"Ashley was such a great help, wonderful customer service! I will be back for sure!!"
106,13-Jun-23,"All the business that I give to this store day after day and they can't even honor their own policy of 7 days return if the item doesn't work...I have my Original receipt and packaging with a battery that didn't last a week, why U don't replace it?STIIIZY YOU Ripped me off...I am a pissed off customer              I WILL NEVER RETURN TO ANY OF THEIR  STORE...TERRIBLE SERVICE!"
107,11-Sep-23,This is my usual spot that's consistent and reliable! We love dependability :p I went in tonight and Jenny helped me today she was sweet!- Rachel Davalos
108,30-Jul-23,"Downtown LA STIIIZY is my spot, I am there every 3 to 4 days always for my Skywalker pod. You can never go wrong with that choice! The Bud-tenders are always upbeat and they move fast. I'm a regular, so it's nice to see the same smiling faces:-) and it's nice that they recognize me as well. Dope music while you wait and on a good day there's some real good deals. (Month of July).Gotta check it out your self."
109,28-Aug-23,"Thank you, Bryan for being so super accommodating and welcoming. Made my second visit to the store very pleasant. Will be coming back for more."
110,2-Jun-23,"Ordered delivery from here. The driver, Johnathan, was Fantastic. I had initially scheduled for 4-6 drop off window but was asked to stay later at work so called and bumped it to 7:30 or later. I'm just barely leaving work at 6:30 and I get a text saying my driver is arriving in 14 minutes. What?!? I text a response stating I bumped it and got an immediate reply saying not to worry he wouldn't bring it until 7:30 or later. When he arrived he was very friendly. Prices were on par with other dispensaries I use in the Glendale area and cheaper than Amuse. Good selection. Will definitely be ordering from them again in the future."
111,31-Jul-23,Best dispensary in LA. Definitely recommend to order online . Staff is always great too
112,26-Jul-23,"All chill to stop at this location !! Always lots of staff the wait is always minimum for the time I always go , those 7 Gs of the black labels  keep it up STIIZY DTLA !!!!"
113,6-Apr-23,"Stacy is my go-to bud tender. She is dope .She has the best personality and bubbly vibe to go with it.  I love her.  I can come in, let her know what's bothering me, and ask her what might do the trick to alleviate whatever my ache or pain might be. She has suggestions like no other and she is very professional.  She helped me a while back and I have not caught her in recently but I""ll always remember her because she was the one who first helped me, on my first visit... some odd eons ago.Sometimes the parking in here can be tricky.  I have a handicapped placard and sometimes there are spots available for me and sometimes there aren't.  Sometimes the guards in the lot neglect the fact that I'm handicapped and need to be parked closer to the entrance of the store.  I don't appreciate that all too much, esp when all of a sudden I find someone without a placard parking in a handicapped sign but might be doing an online pick up or something, like it excludes them from having to follow the rules. I appreciate the employees here who are always so nice to tell me about the new arrivals, new promotions, etc.  They are typically very kind, although I have come across one bud tender who was not too nice to me.  I didn't catch her name.  I wish I'd been ushered to someone else but well, it's too late for all of that. I appreciate that Stiiizy keeps their word and if you are to buy a cartridge for your pen, or a starter pen, they encourage you to keep your receipt and box and to bring it back if there are any issues.  If in the rare instance that you receive items that you hadn't selected, your opportunity to doubt check your order is when they're rung up and what not. I have been here enough times to see customers not pay attention and then get upset when they leave with items that weren't theirs. You've gotta be a responsible consumer!  I love the variety of their pods/cartridges.  I like to switch mine out constantly.  I have a few favorites now and so those are the ones that I typically buy but it's nice to be easily able to change things up as often as I please. So, you can only imagine how much I love to be able to take advantage of their promos on cartridges, esp when I'm a new customer at a different location."
114,31-Aug-23,Been buying stiiizy product before they became this big sensation. I enjoyed and was present to their launch debut party and been a customer ever since. I specially have to give a shout-out  to the the staff that's always at reception they are awesome and kind!! Products and flowers are great and the prices are even better!! I love coming here!!  Might even apply to work here haha
115,27-Jul-23,"I LOVE STIIIZY WITH A PASSION! One of the best if not the best dispensary out here in California. Amazing customer service, employees always treat you with kindness and respect. Always go out of their way to help you out with each purchase. I also love how they handle they're parking situation there is never a time where I have to pull up and I can't find where to park. In Other words you can trust stiiizy with your stoner needs"
116,14-Jul-23,The process to just get 1 pod is like 30min when u get there u need to wait in that first line then u get access to the 2nd long line to see only 3 cashier open wow really all the money yall making and can't even get more cashier wack!!!!
117,11-Sep-23,"Best place to pick up and get almost anything you need from pods, edibles, to good old fashion flower. Great daily deals with a positive crew there to greet you and help you out, I definitely recommend coming here."
118,27-Jul-22,"I love love Stiizy pods, my absolute favorite. I had been to plenty of dispensaries before but never been to the actual stiizy store so when I got the chance I was stoked. The giant warehouse like building was so dope. They had a really nice entrance and once you walk in Hip-op music was playing and the lighting felt like a club. I'm my bud tender was great and I took advantage of a few first time patient deals which I was super happy about. I'll definitely be back asap!"
119,6-Sep-23,"Deeply disturbed by my first experience here. I realized after paying that Linet P. gave me the wrong pod and I asked another employee for the correct one since Linet kept ringing up other customers and not paying attention to me. That second employee spoke to a third employee who spoke to the manager Peter, and Peter told me that they cannot exchange the incorrect pod for the correct one because ""I already walked out with the pod"" (I hadn't) and that on camera ""it looked like I agreed that it was the correct item"" (I hadn't). I asked to see the footage of this interaction and he said that I am not allowed to see their cameras. He kept pushing for me to keep the incorrect one and also buy the correct one. He then lied saying he spoke to Linet, claiming she told him I agreed that I was given the correct pod. I never saw him speak to Linet. While Peter kept holding up the bag with the incorrect item trying to get me to take it, I told him a couple times that I didn't want it and he told him that they can't keep it in the store either, and I just stood there in shock for a while. I also can't believe Linet wouldn't just own up to her mistake and admit that I wanted a different one."
120,3-Aug-23,"First timer and security and staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. The ambience and atmosphere are like stepping into a portal of a very cool Californian Star Wars scene with otherworldly strains of cannabis. Great first impression! Christian really provided top tier customer service!"
121,14-Aug-23,"Coming here for a while, service is always 100%, product is always 100%. Finally used my credit which lowered the value of a pod. Which is cool that this is offered since things do add up. Will continue to come back!!"
122,11-Aug-23,My experience at STIIIZY DTLA has always been good. From the easy check in process to the quality of products.
123,26-Jul-23,"Been coming to stiiizy for over 4 years! Hell i even went to their hubble studios x stiiizy launch party! Amazing flower,from top shelf to mids! Everything for everyone! I always get treated like family! Also the retna artwork is INSANE!   Come by on your next dispo run!"
124,7-Aug-23,"My favorite shop! I make the drive from Downey. Great price, great product, great staff. Love the way it looks when you come in to the place. I mostly order online and just pick up. Depending on the day and time the lines and parking can't be a pain but I still go. I used to go to LA Kush but their prices are ridiculous. Love the herb, edibles, and vapes. Those 40s are bomb too!"
125,30-Jul-23,Welp Yelp! Most people have their happy place whether it's in their heads or a physical one! With that being said STIIIZY is my happy place. After every trip I have my own happy trip (not really a trip more of a relax therapy session) their products are all bomb! Just today I picked up their gelato 41 full gram pod and a cotton candy syrup! Being coming here for 2 plus years and haven't had a bad experience once. Thank you all
126,6-Aug-23,DO not waste your money. I didn't go in store since I am on the east coast. NOTHING But issues. I HAVE BOUGHT 3 and they are all TRASH.  I am beyond mad that i wasted time and money on such a POS product. Buy from literally anyone else.
127,27-Jul-23,This place has everything plus some. I came here for some flowers and left with more than I bargained for weight wise due to daily deals. Carmen helped me find what I needed and even recommended anything she had tried herself. She was knowledgeable on products and was very thorough and professional.
